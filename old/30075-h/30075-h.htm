<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter I</span></h2>
<h3><i>About Silvia and Myself</i></h3>
</div>
<p>Some people have children born unto
them, some acquire children and
others have children thrust upon
them. Silvia and I are of the last named
class. We have no offspring of our own,
but yesterday, today, and forever we have
those of our neighbor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></div>
<p>We were born and bred in the same little
home-grown city and as a small boy, even,
I was Silvia&rsquo;s worshiper, but perforce a
worshiper from afar.</p>
<p>Her upcoming had been supervised by a
grimalkin governess who drew around the
form of her young charge the awful circle
of exclusiveness, intercourse with child-kind
being strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Children are naturally gregarious little
creatures, however, and Silvia on rare
occasions managed to break parole and
make adroit escape from surveillance.
Then she would speed to the top of the
boundary wall that separated the stable
precincts from an alluring alley which
was the playground of the plebeian progeny
of the humble born.</p>
<p>To the circle of dirty but fascinating
ragamuffins she became an interested tangent,
a silent observer. Here I had my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
first meeting with her. I was not of her
class, neither was I to the alley born, but
sailed in the sane mid-channel that ameliorates
the distinction between high and
low life.</p>
<p>On this eventful day I was taking a
short cut on my way to school. One of
the group of alleyites, with the inherent
friendliness of the unchartered but big-hearted
members of the silt of the stream
of humans, had proffered to little Silvia
a chip on which was a patch of mud designed
to become a fruitcake stuffed with
pebbles in lieu of raisins and frosted with
moistened ashes. Before the enticing
pastime of transformation was begun,
however, Silvia was swiftly snatched from
the contaminating midst and borne away
over the ramparts.</p>
<p>Thereafter I haunted the alley, hoping
for another glimpse of the little picture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
girl on the wall. At last I attained my
desire. One Saturday afternoon I saw her
coming, alone, down a long rosebush bordered
path. A thrill ran through me.
Our eyes met. Yet all I found to say
was: &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She responded to this invitation and I
helped her over the wall. She looked
longingly at the Irish playing in the mud,
but a clean sandpile in my own backyard
not far away seemed to me a more fitting
environment for one so daintily clad.</p>
<p>We played undisturbed for a never-to-be-forgotten
half hour and then they found
her out. Reprimanding voices jangled and
the whole world was out of tune.</p>
<p>Thereafter a strict watch was kept on
little Silvia&rsquo;s movements and I saw her
only at rare intervals, when she was
going into church or as she rode past our
house. She always remembered me and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
on such meetings a faint, reminiscent smile
lighted the somber little face and her
eyes met mine as if in a mysterious promise.</p>
<p>She grew up an outlawed, isolated child
deprived of her birthright, but in spite of
the handicaps of so barren a childhood,
she achieved young womanhood unspoiled
and in possession of her early democratic
tendencies.</p>
<p>When I was making a modest start
in a legal way, her parents died and left
her with that most unprofitable of legacies,
an encumbered estate. Then I dared
to renew our acquaintance begun on the
sandpile. She went to live with a poor
but practical relation and was initiated
into the science of stretching an inadequate
income to meet everyday needs.
In time I wooed and won her.</p>
<p>We set up housekeeping in a small,
thriving mid-Western city where I secured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
a partnership in a legal firm. Silvia
had all the requisites of mind and manner
and Domestic Science necessary to a
&ldquo;hearth-and home-&rdquo; maker.</p>
<p>We lived in a house which was one of
many made to the same measure with
the inevitable street porch, big window,
trimmed lawn in front and garden in
the rear. We had attained the standard of
prosperity maintained in our home town
by keeping &ldquo;hired help&rdquo; and installing
a telephone, so our social status was
fixed.</p>
<p>There was but one adjunct missing to
our little Arcadia. While at a word or
look children flocked to me like friendly
puppies in response to a call, to Silvia
they were still an unknown quantity.</p>
<p>I had hoped that her understanding
and love for children might be developed
in the usual and natural way, but we had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
now been married ten years and this hope
had not been realized.</p>
<p>She had tried most assiduously to cultivate
an acquaintance with members of
child-world, but into that kingdom there
is no open sesame. The sure keen intuition
of a child recognizes on sight a kindred
spirit and Silvia&rsquo;s forced advances
met with but indifferent response. She
wistfully proposed to me one day that we
adopt a child. My doubts as to the
advisability of such a course were confirmed
by Huldah, our strong staff in
household help. In our section of the
country servants were generally quite conversant
with the intimate and personal
affairs of the home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you never do it, Mr. Wade,&rdquo; she
counseled. &ldquo;Ready-mades ain&rsquo;t for the
likes of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, in acting on this advice, I vetoed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Silvia&rsquo;s lukewarm proposition, I was convinced
of Huldah&rsquo;s wisdom by seeing the
look of relief that flashed into my wife&rsquo;s
troubled countenance, and I knew that
her suggestion had been but a perfunctory
prompting of duty.</p>
<p>Time alone could overcome the effects of
her early environment!</p>

<h3><i>Introducing Our Next-door Neighbors</i></h3>
</div>
<p>One morning Silvia and I lingered
over our coffee cups discussing our
plans for the coming summer, which
included visits from my sister Beth and my
college chum, Rob Rossiter. We wished
to avoid having their arrivals occur
simultaneously, however, because Rob was
a woman-hater, or thought he was. We
decided to have Beth pay her visit first
and later take Rob with us on our vacation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
trip to some place where the fishing facilities
would be to our liking. However,
summer vacation time like our plans was
yet far, vague and dim.</p>
<div class='figtag'>

</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-007.jpg' alt='' title='' width='210' height='278' /><br />
</div>
<p>While I was putting on my overcoat,
Silvia had gone to the window and was
looking pensively at the vacant house next
to ours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; she said abruptly and irrelevantly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
&ldquo;that we are destined to receive
no part of Uncle Issachar&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Issachar was a wealthy but eccentric
relative of my wife. He had made us
no wedding gift beyond his best wishes,
but he had then informed us that at the
birth of each of our prospective sons he
should place in the bank to Silvia&rsquo;s account
the sum of five thousand dollars. We had
never invited him to visit us or made any
overtures in the way of communication with
him, lest he should think we were cultivating
his acquaintance from mercenary motives.</p>
<p>While I was debating whether the
lament in Silvia&rsquo;s tone was for the loss of
the money or the lack of children, she
again spoke; this time in a tone which
had lost its languor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a big moving van in front of
the house next door. At last we will
have some near neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Are they unloading furniture?&rdquo; I
asked inanely, crossing to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; course not,&rdquo; came cheerfully from
Huldah, who had come in to remove the
dishes. &ldquo;Most likely they are unloading
lions and tigers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have already intimated, Huldah
was a privileged servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are unloading children!&rdquo; explained
Silvia, in a tone implying that
Huldah&rsquo;s sarcastic implication would be
infinitely more preferable. &ldquo;The van
seems to be overflowing with them&ndash;&ndash;a
perfect crowd. Do you suppose the house
is to be used as an orphan asylum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; I assured her as I counted
the flock. Five children would seem like
a crowd to Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; exclaimed Huldah tragically,
as she joined us for a survey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that
they don&rsquo;t keep the grass off our lawn.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>Late that afternoon I opened the outer
door of the dining-room in response to the
rap of strenuously applied knuckles.</p>
<p>A lad of about eleven years with the
sardonic face of a satyr and diabolically
bright eyes peered into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have soup for dinner,&rdquo;
he announced, &ldquo;and mother wants to borrow
a soup plate for father to eat his out of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia stared at him aghast. She seemed
to feel something compelling in the boy&rsquo;s
personnel, however, and she went to the
china closet and brought forth a soup plate
which she handed to him without comment.</p>
<p>In silence we watched him run across
the lawn, twirling the plate deftly above
his head in juggler fashion.</p>
<p>The next day when we sat down to
dinner our new young neighbor again
appeared on our threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; he called chummily. &ldquo;We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
are going to have soup again and we want
a soup plate for father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the one I loaned you yesterday?&rdquo;
demanded Silvia in a tone far
below thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit, while
her features assumed a frigidity that would
have congealed father&rsquo;s favorite sustenance
had it been in her vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we broke that!&rdquo; he casually and
cheerfully explained.</p>
<p>With much reluctance Silvia bestowed
another plate upon the young applicant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; I said as he started to leave,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want the soup tureen, too, or
the ladle and some soup spoons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; he answered politely.
&ldquo;None of the rest of us like soup, so we
dish father&rsquo;s up in the kitchen. He
doesn&rsquo;t like soup particularly, but he eats
it because it goes down quick and lets him
have more time for work.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>This time as he sped homeward, he
didn&rsquo;t spin the plate in air, but tried
out a new plan of balancing it on a
stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; I suggested gently, when our
young neighbor was lost to our sorrowful
sight, &ldquo;that it might be well to invest in
another dozen or so of soup plates. I will
see about getting them at wholesale rates.
Our supply will soon give out if our new
neighbors continue to cultivate the soup
and borrowing habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will buy some at the five cent store,&rdquo;
replied Silvia. &ldquo;I think I had better call
upon them tomorrow and see what manner
of people they can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I came home the next day it was
quite evident that she had called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I inquired, &ldquo;what do they keep&ndash;&ndash;a
soup house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are literary people, the highest of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
high-brows. Their name is Polydore, and
the head of the house&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. or Mrs.?&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The head of the house,&rdquo; pursued Silvia,
ignoring my question, &ldquo;is a collector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I inferred. Has he a large collection
of soup plates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She collects antiquities and writes their
history. He pursues science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were seemingly communicative.
What did they look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see them. After I rang I heard
a woman&rsquo;s voice bidding some one not to
answer the bell. She said she couldn&rsquo;t be
bothered with interruptions, so I went on
up the street to call on Mrs. Fleming, who
told me all about them. She was also refused
admittance when she called. On my way
home I met that boy&ndash;&ndash;that awful boy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, evidently overcome by the
consideration of his awfulness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He had been digging bait&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she paused as if words were inadequate
for her climax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was carrying his bait&ndash;&ndash;horrid,
wriggling angleworms&ndash;&ndash;in our soup
plate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is not broken yet!&rdquo; I exclaimed
joyfully. &ldquo;Let us hope it is given
an antiseptic bath before father&rsquo;s next
indulgence in consomm&eacute;. After dinner I
will go over and try my luck at paying my
respects to the soup savant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t let you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I shall follow their lead of
setting aside all ceremony and formality
and admit myself, as their heir apparent
does here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner and my twilight smoke, I
went next door, first asking Silvia if there
was anything we needed that I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
borrow, just to show them there were no
hard feelings.</p>
<p>My third vigorous ring brought results.
A slipshod servant appeared and
reluctantly seated me in the hall. She
read with seeming interest the card I
handed to her and then, pushing aside
some mangy looking porti&egrave;res, vanished
from view.</p>
<p>She evidently delivered my card, for I
heard a woman&rsquo;s voice read my name,
&ldquo;Mr. Lucien Wade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another short interval the slovenly
servant returned and offered me my
card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seen it,&rdquo; she assured me in answer
to my look of surprise.</p>
<p>She again put the porti&egrave;res between us
and I was obliged to own myself baffled
in my efforts to break in. I was showing
myself out when my onward course was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
deflected by a troop of noisy children
leaded by the soup plate skirmisher, who
was the oldest and apparently the leader
of the brood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, halloa!&rdquo; he greeted me with the
air of an old acquaintance, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you
see the folks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my informing him that I had seen
no one but the servant, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that chicken wouldn&rsquo;t know
enough to ask you in! Just follow us.
Mother wouldn&rsquo;t remember to come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was loth to force my presence on
mother, but by this time my hospitable
young friend had pulled the porti&egrave;res so
strenuously that they parted from the pole,
and I was presented willy nilly to the
collector of antiquities, who had the
angular sharp-cut face and form of a
rocking horse. She was seated at a table
strewn with books and papers, writing at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
a rate of speed that convinced me she was
in the throes of an inspiration. I forebore
to interrupt. My scruples, however, were
not shared by her eldest son. He gave
her elbow a jog of reminder which sent her
pencil to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he shouted in megaphone
voice, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the man next door&ndash;&ndash;the
one we get our soup plates from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up abstractedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said in dismayed tone, &ldquo;I
thought you had gone. I am very much
engaged in writing a paper on modern
antiquities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I murmured some sort of an apology for
my untimely interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so absorbed in my great work,&rdquo;
she explained, &ldquo;that I am oblivious to all
else. I have the rare and great gift of
concentration in a marked degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was quite sure of this fact. She took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
another pencil from a supply box and
resumed her literary occupation. As my
presence seemed of so little moment, I
lingered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; shouted one of the boys,
snatching the pencil from her grasp, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
hungry. I didn&rsquo;t have any supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did!&rdquo; she asserted. &ldquo;I saw
Gladys give you a bowl of bread and
milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emerald took it away from me and
drank it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t neither!&rdquo; denied a shaggy looking
boy. &ldquo;I spilled it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He accompanied this denial by a fierce
punch in his accuser&rsquo;s ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said the author of Modern
Antiquities, taking a nickel from her
pocket, &ldquo;go get yourself some popcorn,
Demetrius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t Demetrius! I&rsquo;m Pythagoras.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference. Go and get it
and don&rsquo;t speak to me again tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy had already snatched the coin,
and he now started for the exit, but his
outgoing way was instantly blocked by a
promiscuous pack of pugilistic Polydores,
and an ardent and general onslaught
followed.</p>
<p>I endeavored to untangle the arms and
legs of the attackers and the attacked in
a desire to rescue the youngest, a child
of two, but I soon beat a retreat, having
no mind to become a punching bag for
Polydores.</p>
<p>The concentrator at the writing table,
looking up vaguely, perceived the general
joust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How provoking!&rdquo; she exclaimed indignantly.
&ldquo;I was in search of an antonym
and now they&rsquo;ve driven it out of my
memory.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>I politely offered my sympathy for her loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such misbehaved
children?&rdquo; she asked casually and impersonally
as she calmly surveyed the
free-for-all fight.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_3' id='linki_3'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-008.jpg' alt='' title='' width='157' height='293' /><br />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Children always misbehave before company,&rdquo;
I remarked propitiatingly. &ldquo;Of
course they know better.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why no, they don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she declared,
looking at me in surprise, &ldquo;they&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this instant the errant antonym
evidently flashed upon her mental vision
and her pencil hastened to record it and
then flew on at lightning speed.</p>
<p>I was about to try to make an escape
when a momentary cessation of hostilities
was caused by the entrance of a moth-eaten,
abstracted-looking man. As the
<i>two-year-old</i> hailed him as &ldquo;fadder&rdquo;, I
gathered that he was the person responsible
for the family now fighting at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; he asked helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gave Thag a nickel,&rdquo; explained the
eldest boy, &ldquo;and we want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man drew a sigh of relief. The
solution of this family problem was instantly
and satisfactorily met by an impartial
distribution of nickels.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>With demoniac whoops of delight, the
contestants fled from the room.</p>
<p>I introduced myself to the man of the
house, who seemed to realize that some
sort of compulsory conventionalities must
be observed. He looked hopelessly at his
wife, and seeing that she was beyond response
to an S O S call to things mundane,
he frankly but impressively informed me
that I must expect nothing of them socially
as their lives were devoted to research
and study. The children, however,
he assured me, could run over frequently
to see us.</p>
<p>I instinctively felt that my call was considered
ended, so I took my departure. I
related the details of my neighborly visit
to Silvia, but her sense of humor was not
stirred. It was entirely dominated by her
dread of the young Polydores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many children are there?&rdquo; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
asked faintly. &ldquo;More than the five you
said you counted that first day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seemed not so many as much.
That is, though I suppose in round
numbers there are but five, yet each of
those five is equal to at least three ordinary
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they all boys? Huldah says the
youngest wears dresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless he is a boy. They are all
unmistakably boys. I think they must
have been born with boots on and,&rdquo; conscious
of the imprints of my shins, &ldquo;hobnail
boots at that. Even the youngest, a
two-year old, seems to have been graduated
from Home Rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to think of their going to
bed hungry,&rdquo; she said wistfully. &ldquo;Think
of that unnatural mother expecting them
to satisfy their hunger by popcorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t though,&rdquo; I assured her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
&ldquo;I saw them stop a street vender below
here and invest their nickels in hot
dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot dogs!&rdquo; repeated Silvia in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wienerwursts,&rdquo; I hastened to interpret.</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter III</span></h2>
<h3><i>In Which We Are Pestered by Polydores</i></h3>
</div>
<p>Our life now became one long round
of Polydores. They were with us
burr-tight, and attached themselves
to me with dog-like devotion, remaining
utterly impervious to Silvia&rsquo;s aloofness
and repulses. At last, however, she succumbed
to their presence as one of the
things inevitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Polydores are here to stay,&rdquo; she
acknowledged in a calmness-of-despair voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to be homebodies,&rdquo;
I allowed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>The children were not literary like the
other productions of their profound
parents, but were a band of robust, active
youngsters unburdened with brains, excepting
Ptolemy of soup plate fame. Not
that he betrayed any tendencies toward a
learned line, but he was possessed of an
occult, uncanny, wizard-like wisdom that
was disconcerting. His contemplative eyes
seemed to search my soul and read my inmost
thoughts.</p>
<p>Pythagoras, Emerald, and Demetrius,
aged respectively nine, eight, and seven,
were very much alike in looks and size,
being so many pinched caricatures of their
mother. To Silvia they were bewildering
whirlwinds, but Huldah, who seemed to
have difficulty in telling them apart, always
classified them as &ldquo;Them three&rdquo;, and
Silvia and I fell into the habit of referring
to them in the same way. Huldah could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
not master the Polydore given names either
by memory or pronunciation. Ptolemy,
whose name was shortened to &ldquo;Tolly&rdquo; by
Diogenes, she called &ldquo;Polly.&rdquo; When she
was on speaking terms with &ldquo;Them three&rdquo;
she nicknamed them &ldquo;Thaggy, Emmy, and
Meetie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diogenes, the two-year old, was a Tartar
when emulating his brothers. Alone, he
was sometimes normal and a shade more
like ordinary children.</p>
<p>When they first began swarming in
upon us, Silvia drew many lines which,
however, the Polydores promptly effaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall not eat here, anyway,&rdquo;
she emphatically declared.</p>
<p>This was her last stand and she went
down ingloriously.</p>
<p>One day while we were seated at the
table enjoying some of Huldah&rsquo;s most
palatable dishes, Ptolemy came in. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
ensued on our part a silence which the lad
made no effort to break. Silvia and I
each slipped him a side glance. He stood
statuesque, watching us with the mute
wistfulness of a hungry animal. There
were unwonted small red specks high upon
his cheekbones, symptoms, Silvia thought,
of starvation.</p>
<p>She was moved to ask, though reluctantly
and perfunctorily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been to dinner, Ptolemy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted quickly, &ldquo;but I
could eat another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assuming that the forced inquiry was
an invitation, before protest could be
entered he supplied himself with a plate
and helped himself to food. His need and
relish of the meal weakened Silvia&rsquo;s fortifications.</p>
<p>This opening, of course, was the wedge
that let in other Polydores, and thereafter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
we seldom sat down to a meal without the
presence of one or more members of the
illustrious and famished family, who made
themselves as entirely at home as would
a troop of foraging soldiers. Silvia gazed
upon their devouring of food with the
same surprised, shocked, and yet interested
manner in which one watches the
feeding of animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he ought not to eat so many
pickles,&rdquo; she remarked one day, as Emerald
consumed his ninth Dill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill a Polydore,&rdquo; I assured her.</p>
<p>I never opened a door but more or less
Polydores fell in. They were at the left
of us and at the right of us, with Diogenes
always under foot. We had no privacy.
I found myself waking suddenly in the
night with the uncomfortable feeling that
Ptolemy lurked in a dark corner or two
of my bedroom.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>Even Silvia&rsquo;s boudoir was not free from
their invasion. But one door in our house
remained closed to them. They found no
open sesame to Huldah&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she would let me in on her system,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;I wonder how she manages
to keep them on the outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you,&rdquo; confided Silvia. &ldquo;Emerald
and Demetrius went in one day and
she dropped Demetrius out the window
and kicked Emerald out the door. You
know, Lucien, you are too softhearted to
resort to such measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was once,&rdquo; I confessed, &ldquo;but I think
under Polydore r&eacute;gime I am getting stoical
enough to follow in Huldah&rsquo;s footsteps
and go her one better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our conversation was interrupted by
the entrance of Diogenes.</p>
<p>Silvia screamed.</p>
<p>Turning to see what the latest Polydore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
perpetration might be, I saw that Diogenes
was frothing at the mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s having a fit!&rdquo; exclaimed
Silvia frantically. &ldquo;Call Huldah! Put
him in a hot bath. Quick, Lucien, turn
on the hot water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; I refused grimly. &ldquo;Let him
have a fit and fall in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t got no fit,&rdquo; was the cheerful
assurance of Pythagoras, as he sauntered in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother would have one,&rdquo; I told
him, &ldquo;if she could hear your English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with him?&rdquo; asked
Silvia. &ldquo;Does he often foam in this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been eating your tooth powder,&rdquo;
explained Pythagoras. &ldquo;He likes it &rsquo;cause
it tastes like peppermint, and then he
drank some water before he swallowed
the powder and it all fizzed up and run out
his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wondered,&rdquo; said Silvia ruefully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
&ldquo;what made my tooth powder disappear
so rapidly. What shall I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resort to strategy!&rdquo; I advised. &ldquo;Lock
up your powder hereafter and fill an empty
bottle with powdered alum or something
worse and leave it around handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien!&rdquo; exclaimed my wife, who could
not seem to recover from this latest annoyance,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can be so
fond of children. I did hope&ndash;&ndash;for your
sake and&ndash;&ndash;on account of Uncle Issachar&rsquo;s
offer that I&rsquo;d like to have one&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;d
rather go to the poorhouse! I&rsquo;d almost lose
your affection rather than have a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Silvia!&rdquo; I remonstrated in dismay,
&ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t judge all by these.
They&rsquo;re not fair samples. They&rsquo;re not
children&ndash;&ndash;not home-grown children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; agreed Huldah,
who had come into the room. &ldquo;They are
imps&ndash;&ndash;imps of the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>I believe she was right. They had a
generally demoralizing effect on our household.
I was growing irritable, Silvia careworn.
Even Huldah showed their influence
by acquiring the very latest in slang
from them. Once in a while to my amusement
I heard Silvia unconsciously adopting
the Polydore argot.</p>
<p>As the result of their better nourishment
at our table, the imps of the devil
daily grew more obstreperous and life
became so burdensome to Silvia that I
proposed moving away to a childless neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d find us out,&rdquo; said Silvia wearily,
&ldquo;wherever we went. Distance would be
no obstacle to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we might move out of town, as a
last resort,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Rob says he
thinks there is a good legal field in&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Lucien,&rdquo; vetoed Silvia. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
a fine practice here, and then there&rsquo;s that
attorneyship for the Bartwell Manufacturing
Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hope of securing this appointment
meant a good deal to us. We were now
living up to every cent of my income
and though we had the necessities, it was
the luxuries of life I craved&ndash;&ndash;for Silvia&rsquo;s
sake. She was a lover of music and we
had no piano. She yearned to ride and
she had no horse. We both had longings
for a touring-car and we wanted to travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of a scheme for a little
respite from the sight and sound of the
Polydores,&rdquo; I remarked one day. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
enter them in the public school. There
are four more weeks yet before the long
summer vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be too good to be true,&rdquo;
declared Silvia. &ldquo;Five or six hours each
day, and then, too, their deportment will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
be so dreadful that they will have to stay
after school hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought more likely their deportment
would lead to suspension, but forbore to
wet-blanket Silvia&rsquo;s hopes.</p>
<p>I made my second call upon the male
head of the House of Polydore to recommend
and urge that its young scions be
sent to the public school. I had misgivings
as to the outcome of my proposition,
as the Polydore parents believed
themselves to be the only fount of learning
in the town. To my surprise and
intense gratification, my suggestion met
with no objections whatever. Felix Polydore
referred me to his wife and said he
would abide by her decision. I found her,
of course, buried in books, but remembering
Ptolemy&rsquo;s mode of gaining attention,
I peremptorily closed the volume she was
studying.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>My audacity attained its object and I
proferred my request, laying great stress
on the quietude she would gain thereby.
She replied that attendance at school would
doubtless do them no harm, although she
expressed her belief that the most thorough
educations were those obtained outside of
schools.</p>
<p>Silvia was wafted into the eighth heaven
of bliss and then some, as the result of my
diplomatic mission. Of course the task of
preparing pupils out of the pestiferous
Polydores devolved upon her, but she was
actively aided by the eager and willing
Huldah and between them they pushed the
project that promised such an elysium with
all speed. The prospective pupils themselves
were not wildly enthusiastic over this
curtailment of their liberty, but Huldah
won the day by proposing that they carry
their luncheon with them, promising an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
abundant supply of sugared doughnuts
and small pies.</p>
<p>Pythagoras foresaw recreation ahead in
the opportunity to &ldquo;lick all the kids,&rdquo;
and I assumed that Ptolemy had deep
laid schemes for the outmaneuvering of
teachers, but as his left hand never made
confidant of his right, I could not expect to
fathom the workings of his mind.</p>
<p>Early on a Monday morning, therefore,
our household arose to lick our Polydore
prot&eacute;g&eacute;s into a shape presentable for admission
to school. It took two hours to
pull up stockings and make them stay
pulled, tie shoestrings, comb out tangles,
adjust collars and neckties, to say nothing
of vigorous scrubbings to five grimy faces
and ten dirt-stained hands.</p>
<p>At last with an air of achievement Silvia
corralled her round-up and unloaded the
four eldest upon the public school and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
proceeded to install the protesting Diogenes
in a nursery kindergarten. Huldah
stood in the doorway as they marched off
and sped the parting guests with a muttered
&ldquo;Good riddance to bad rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia returned radiant, but her rejoicing
was shortlived. She had scarcely taken
off her hat and gloves when the four oldest
came trooping and whooping into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; gasped Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to be vaccinated,&rdquo; explained
Ptolemy with an appreciative grin. Of all
the Polydores he was the one who had least
objected to scholastic pursuits, but he
seemed quite jubilant at our discomfiture.</p>
<p>We were somewhat reluctant to undertake
the responsibility of their inoculation,
especially after Ptolemy told us that his
mother didn&rsquo;t believe in vaccination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em down and get &rsquo;em vaccinated
right,&rdquo; declared Huldah. &ldquo;Their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
ma won&rsquo;t never notice the scars, and if
one of you young uns blabs about it,&rdquo;
she added, turning upon them ferociously,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut your tongue out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose there should be some ill result
from it,&rdquo; said Silvia apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry!&rdquo; exclaimed Huldah.
&ldquo;Most likely it won&rsquo;t amount to anything.
It&rsquo;ll take some new kind of scabs to work
in these brats. They&rsquo;re too tough to take
anything. Come on now with me,&rdquo; she
commanded, &ldquo;and after it&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll
get you each an ice cream sody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through Huldah&rsquo;s efficiency the vaccination
was quickly accomplished and
the children of our neighbor were reluctantly
accepted by the school authorities.</p>
<p>The Polydores were not parted by reason
of dissimilarity of age or learning, as
they were put into the ungraded room.
To keep them there enrolled taxed to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
utmost our ingenuity in the way of framing
excuses for their repeated cases of
tardiness and suspension.</p>
<p>Silvia felt a little remorseful when she
listened to the tale of woe recited to her
by their teacher at a card party one Saturday
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said,&rdquo; my wife repeated, &ldquo;that
yesterday Pythagoras brought two mice to
school in his marble-bag and let them loose.
She doesn&rsquo;t believe in corporal punishment,
but she determined to experiment with its
effect on Pythagoras, so she kept him and
Emerald, who was slightly implicated, after
school and sent the latter out to get a
whip. When he came back he said: &lsquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t find any stick, but here&rsquo;s some
rocks you can throw at him,&rsquo; and handed
her a hat full of stones. This made her
too hysterical to try her experiment, so
she took away his recess for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to make her a present,&rdquo; I
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said,&rdquo; continued Silvia, &ldquo;that they
had given her nervous prostration, but
she had no time to prostrate, and if she
didn&rsquo;t succeed in getting them graded by
the coming fall term, she should accept an
offer of marriage she had received from a
cross-eyed man, and you know how unlucky
that would be, Lucien!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be driven to worse things than
that by fall,&rdquo; I replied ruefully.</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter IV</span></h2>
<h3><i>In Which We Take Boarders</i></h3>
</div>
<p>Four weeks of unalloyed bliss and
then the summer vacation times
arrived, bringing joy to the heart
of the Polydores and the teacher of the
ungraded room, but deep gloom to the
hearthside of the Wades.</p>
<p>One misfortune always brings another.
A rival applicant received the coveted attorneyship
and we bade a sad farewell to piano,
saddle-horse, automobile and journey, the
furnishings to our Little House of Dreams.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I did want you to have a car, Lucien,&rdquo;
sighed Silvia, regretfully, &ldquo;and you worked
so hard this last year, you need a trip.
Won&rsquo;t you go somewhere with Rob&ndash;&ndash;without
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured her it would be no vacation
without her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Lucien,&rdquo; she proposed
diffidently, &ldquo;I think it would be an excellent
plan to invite Uncle Issachar to visit
us. He knows no more about children than
I do&ndash;&ndash;than I did, I mean, and if he should
see the Polydores he&rsquo;d give us five thousand
each for the children we didn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t consent to this plan. I had
met Uncle Issachar once. He was a crusty
old bachelor with a morbid suspicion that
everyone was working him for his money.
I don&rsquo;t wonder he thought so. He had no
other attractions.</p>
<p>Perceiving the strength of my opposition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
Silvia sweetly and sagaciously refrained
from further pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should not repine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We
have health and happiness and love.
What are pianos and cars and trips compared
to such assets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What, indeed! I admitted that things
might be worse.</p>
<p>Alas! All too soon was my statement
substantiated. That night after we had
gone to bed, I heard a taxicab sputtering
away at the house next door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Polydores must have unexpected
guests,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust they brought no children with
them,&rdquo; murmured Silvia drowsily.</p>
<p>The next morning while we were at
breakfast, the odor of June roses wafting
in through the open window, the delicious
flavor of red-ripe strawberries tickling our
palate, and the anticipation of rice griddle-cakes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
exhilarating us, the millennium
came.</p>
<p>For the five young Polydores bore down
upon us <i>en masse</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father and mother have gone away,&rdquo;
proclaimed Ptolemy, who was always
spokesman for the quintette.</p>
<p>This intelligence was of no particular
interest to us&ndash;&ndash;not then, at least. We
rarely saw father and mother Polydore,
and they were apparently of no need to
their offspring.</p>
<p>Ptolemy&rsquo;s next announcement, however,
was startling and effective in its dramatic
intensity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come over to stay with you
while they are away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed; jocosely, I thought.</p>
<p>Silvia paid no heed to my forced hilarity,
but ejaculated gaspingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They have gone away somewhere,&rdquo;
enlightened our oracle. &ldquo;They went to the
train last night in a taxi. They have gone
somewhere to find out something about
some kind of aborigines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which reminds me,&rdquo; I remarked reminiscently,
&ldquo;of the man who traveled far
and vainly in search of a certain plant
which, on his return, he found growing
beside his own doorstep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia paid no heed to my misplaced
pleasantry. She was right&ndash;&ndash;as usual. It
was no time for levity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; spoke my unappreciative
wife, addressing Ptolemy, &ldquo;why their absence
should make any difference in your
remaining at home. Gladys can cook your
meals and put Diogenes to bed as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladys has gone,&rdquo; piped Demetrius.
&ldquo;She left yesterday afternoon. She was
only staying till she could get her pay.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Father forgot to get another girl in her
place,&rdquo; informed Ptolemy, &ldquo;and he forgot
to tell mother he had forgotten until just
before they went to the train. She said it
didn&rsquo;t matter&ndash;&ndash;that we could just as well
come over here and stay with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said,&rdquo; added Pythagoras, &ldquo;that
you were so crazy over children, that
probably you&rsquo;d be glad to have us stay
with you all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My last strawberry remained poised in
mid-air. It was quite apparent to me now
that there was nothing funny about this
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milk, milk!&rdquo; whimpered Diogenes, pulling
at Silvia&rsquo;s dress and making frantic
efforts to reach the cream pitcher.</p>
<p>Huldah had come in with the griddle-cakes
during this avalanche of news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, all you kids!&rdquo; commanded our
field marshal, as she picked up Diogenes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
&ldquo;beat it to the kitchen, and I&rsquo;ll give you
some breakfast. Hustle up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Polydores, whose eyes were bulging
with expectancy and semi-starvation, tumbled
over each other in their eagerness to
&ldquo;hustle up and beat it to the kitchen.&rdquo;
Our oiler of troubled waters followed, and
there was assurance of a brief lull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do!&rdquo; I exclaimed helplessly
when the door had closed on the
last Polydore. I felt too limp and impotent
to cope with the situation. Not so
Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; she echoed with an intensity of
tone and feeling I had never known her to
display. &ldquo;Do! We&rsquo;ll do something, I am
sure! I will not for a moment submit to
such an imposition. Who ever heard of
such colossal nerve! That father and
mother should be brought back and prosecuted.
I shall report them to the Society
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
But we won&rsquo;t wait for such procedure.
We&rsquo;ll express each and every Polydore to
them at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should certainly do that P.D.Q. and
C.O.D.,&rdquo; I acquiesced, &ldquo;if the Polydore
parents could be located, but you know
the abodes of aborigines are many and
scattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My remarks seemed to fall as flat as
the flapjacks I was siruping.</p>
<p>Silvia arose, determination in every lineament
and muscle, and crossed the room.
She opened the door leading into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptolemy,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;where have
your father and mother gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came forward and replied in a voice
somewhat smothered by cakes and sirup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. They didn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can find out from the ticket-agent,&rdquo;
I optimistically assured her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They never bother to buy tickets. Pay
on the train,&rdquo; Ptolemy explained.</p>
<p>My legal habit of counter-argument asserted
itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can easily ascertain to what point
their baggage was checked,&rdquo; I remarked,
again essaying to maintain a r&ocirc;le of good
cheer.</p>
<p>But the pessimistic Ptolemy was right
there with another of his gloom-casting
retaliations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They only took suit-cases and they
always keep them in the car. Here&rsquo;s a
check father said to give you to pay for
our board. He said you could write in
any amount you wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got a lot of dough yesterday,&rdquo; informed
Pythagoras, &ldquo;and he put half of it
in the bank here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ptolemy handed over a check which was
blank except for Felix Polydore&rsquo;s signature.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; I weakly exclaimed when
my wife had closed the kitchen door, &ldquo;why
she put them off on <i>us</i>. Why didn&rsquo;t she
trade her brats off for antiques?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia eyed the check wistfully. I could
read the unspoken thought that here, perhaps,
was the opportunity for our much-desired
trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Silvia,&rdquo; I answered quickly, &ldquo;not
for any number of blank checks or vacation
trips shall you have the care and annoyance
of those wild Comanches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; she exclaimed
suddenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go right down to the intelligence
office and get anything in the
shape of a maid and put her in charge of
the Polydore caravansary with double
wages and every night out and any other
privileges she requests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed a sane and sensible arrangement,
and I wended my way to my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
office feeling that we were out of the
woods.</p>
<p>When I returned home at noon, I found
that we had only exchanged the woods for
water&ndash;&ndash;and deep water at that.</p>
<p>I beheld a strange sight. Silvia sat by
our bedroom window twittering soft, cooing
nonsensical nothings to Diogenes, who
was clasped in her arms, his flushed little
face pressed close to her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been quite ill, Lucien. I was
frightened and called the doctor. He said
it was only the slight fever that children are
subject to. He thought with good care
that he&rsquo;d be all right in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you succeed in getting a cook to
go to the Polydores?&rdquo; I asked anxiously.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need a nurse to go there, too, to
take care of Diogenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me reproachfully and rebukingly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lucien! You don&rsquo;t suppose I
could send this sick baby back to that uninviting
house with only hired help in
charge! Besides, I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d stay
with a stranger. He seems to have taken
a fancy to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diogenes confirmed this belief by a
languid lifting of his eyelids, as he feelingly
patted her cheek with his baby fingers.</p>
<p>I forebore to suggest that the fancy
seemed to be mutual. Diogenes, sick, was
no longer an &ldquo;imp of the devil&rdquo;, but a
normal, appealing little child. It occurred
to me that possibly the care of a sick
Polydore might develop Silvia&rsquo;s tiny germ
of child-ken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep him here of course,&rdquo; I agreed,
&ldquo;but&ndash;&ndash;the other children must return
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diogenes would miss them,&rdquo; she said
quickly, &ldquo;and the doctor says his whims
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
must be humored while he is sick. He is
almost asleep now. I think he will let me
put him down in his own little bed. Ptolemy
brought it over here. Pull back the
covers for me, Lucien. There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diogenes half opened his eyes, as she
laid him in the bed and smiled wanly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mudder!&rdquo; he cooed.</p>
<p>Silvia flushed and looked as if she dreaded
some expression of mirth from me. Relieved
by my silence and a suggestion of
moisture in the region of my eyes&ndash;&ndash;the
day was quite warm&ndash;&ndash;she confessed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has called me that all the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a wise Polydore that knows
its own parents,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>The slight illness of Diogenes lasted three
or four days. I still shudder to recall the
memory of that hideous period. Silvia&rsquo;s
time and attention were devoted to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
sick child. Huldah was putting in all her
leisure moments at the dentist&rsquo;s, where
she was acquiring her third set of teeth,
and joy rode unconfined and unrestrained
with our &ldquo;boarders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polydore proclivities made the Reign of
Terror formerly known as the French
Revolution seem like an ice cream festival.
I don&rsquo;t regard myself as a particularly
nervous man, but there&rsquo;s a limit! Their
war whoops and screeches got on my
nerves and temper to the extent of sending
me into their midst one evening brandishing
a whip and commanding immediate
silence. I got it. Not through fear of
chastisement, for fear was an emotion
unknown to a Polydore, but from astonishment
at so unexpected a procedure
from so unexpected a source. Heretofore
I had either ignored them or frolicked
with them. Before they had recovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
from their shock, Silvia appeared on the
scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diogenes,&rdquo; she informed them, &ldquo;was
not used to such unwonted quiet, and was
fretting at the unaccustomed stillness.
Would the boys please play Indian or some
of their games again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys would. I backed from the
room, the whip behind me, carefully kept
without Silvia&rsquo;s angle of vision. Before
Ptolemy resumed his r&ocirc;le of chief, he bestowed
a knowing and maddening wink
upon me.</p>
<p>I wished that we had remained neighbor-less.
I wished that the aborigines would
scalp Felix Polydore and the writer of
Modern Antiquities. Then we could land
their brats on the Probate Court. I wished
that this were the reign of Herod. I vowed
I would backslide from the Presbyterian
faith since it no longer included in its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
articles of belief the eternal damnation of
infants. How long, O Catiline, would&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>A paralyzing suspicion flashed into the
maelstrom of my vituperative maledictions.
I rushed wildly upstairs to our combination
bedroom, sickroom, and nursery, where
Silvia sat like a guardian angel beside the
Polydore patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silvia,&rdquo; I shouted excitedly, &ldquo;do you
suppose those diabolical Polydore parents
purposely played this trick on us? Was
it a premeditated Polydore plan to abandon
their young? And can you blame
them for playing us for easy marks? Could
any parents, Polydore, or otherwise, ever
come back to such fiends as these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she cautioned, without so much
as a glance in my direction. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wake
Diogenes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wake Diogenes! Ye Gods! And she
had also implored the brothers of Diogenes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
to continue their anvil chorus! This took
the last stitch of starch from my manly
bosom. Spiritless and spineless I bore all
things, believed all things&ndash;&ndash;but hoped
for nothing.</p>

<h3><i>In Which We Take a Vacation</i></h3>
</div>
<p>Diogenes finally convalesced to
his former state of ruggedness and
obstreperousness. He continued,
however, to cling to Silvia and to call her
&ldquo;mudder.&rdquo; To my amusement the other
children followed suit and she was now
&ldquo;muddered&rdquo; by all the Polydores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;that they
scorn to include me in their adoption. I
wouldn&rsquo;t fancy being &lsquo;faddered&rsquo; by the
Polydores.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Ptolemy, appearing
seemingly from nowhere, assured me.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve named you stepdaddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it be possible, Silvia,&rdquo; I implored,
&ldquo;let this cup pass from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going down to the intelligence
office today,&rdquo; replied Silvia soothingly.
&ldquo;Diogenes is well enough to go home now,
and I can run over there every evening
and see that he is properly put to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went down town feeling like a mule
relieved of his pack.</p>
<p>When I came home that afternoon, I found
Silvia sitting on the shaded porch serenely
sewing. A Sabbath-like stillness pervaded.
Not a Polydore in sight or sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I cried buoyantly. &ldquo;The Polydores
have been returned to their home
station!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied calmly. &ldquo;They told
me at the intelligence office that it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
be absolutely impossible to persuade, bribe,
or hire a servant to assume the charge of
the Polydore place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I said glumly, &ldquo;that Gladys
gave the job a double cross. But will you
please account for the phenomenon of the
utter absence of Polydores at the present
period? Has Huldah at last carried out
her oft-repeated threat of exterminating
the Polydore race?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pythagoras,&rdquo; explained Silvia dejectedly,
&ldquo;has gone to the doctor&rsquo;s. He broke
his wrist this morning. Diogenes is lost
and Emerald has gone to look for him&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why hunt him up?&rdquo; I remonstrated.
&ldquo;Maybe Emerald, too, will get lost or
strayed or stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huldah,&rdquo; continued Silvia, &ldquo;has locked
Demetrius in the cellar. I am unable to
report on Ptolemy. Huldah is half sick,
but she won&rsquo;t go to bed. She said no beds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
in Bedlamite for her. But I have a wonderful
plan to suggest. There is relief in sight
if you will consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will consent to any committable
crime on the calendar,&rdquo; I assured her,
&ldquo;that will lead to the parting of the Polydore
path from ours. Divulge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both need a change and rest. Today
I heard of a most alluring, inexpensive,
unfrequented resort called Hope Haven.
Unfashionable, fine fishing, beautiful scenery,
twelve miles from a railroad, and a
stage stops there but once a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is such a place, we&rsquo;ll go there
at once, though why such an enticing spot
should be unfrequented is beyond me. Do
we leave the Polydores to their fate, or as
a town charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave them to Huldah. She
offered to keep them here if we&rsquo;d take
the outing. She said she&rsquo;d either give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
them free rein or beat their brains out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I see where the Polydores land
in a juvenile jail, or else I return to defend
Huldah for a charge of murder. We&rsquo;ll
take our departure by night&ndash;&ndash;tomorrow
night&ndash;&ndash;and like the Arabs, or the Polydore
parents, silently steal away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien,&rdquo; said Silvia constrainedly, when
we had arranged the details of our plan, &ldquo;if
you wouldn&rsquo;t object too much, I should
like to take Diogenes with us. He hasn&rsquo;t
missed his mother, but I really believe he&rsquo;d
be homesick without me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him, of course,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
manageable away from the others. I
plainly see you&rsquo;ve formed the Polydore
habit, and maybe a partial parting from
the Polydores would be wiser, but we&rsquo;ll
take Diogenes as an antidote against
too perfect a time. But I forgot to tell
you that I had a letter from Rob today.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
He plans to come and make his visit now
and will arrive next Monday. I&rsquo;ll write
him to join us at Hope Haven. You must
write down again for me the route we take
to get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia laughed hopelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never rains but it pours. I had a
letter from Beth this afternoon, and she
says she would like to come to us now.
She arrives Monday. Here is her letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great minds! It is quite a coincidence,&rdquo;
I declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would be so nice to have
Beth go with us to this resort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That is,
they can&rsquo;t both go. I am not going to let
even Rob Rossiter slight my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still it would be a triumph to have her
change his mind&ndash;&ndash;or his heart. You
know a woman-hater always succumbs to
the right girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;In books, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been scanning Beth&rsquo;s letter and I
laughed derisively as I read aloud: &ldquo;&lsquo;I am
so curious to see those next-door children.
When you first wrote of the &ldquo;Polydores&rdquo;
I never once thought of them as children.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thought exactly right,&rdquo; I told
Silvia, and then continued reading: &ldquo;&lsquo;I
supposed them to be something like tadpoles
or polliwogs. I really think I shall
enjoy them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would serve her right,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to
let her come and stay with them here in
our absence. She&rsquo;d get the cure for enjoyment
all right. Rob wrote of them in
the same strain and says he, too, is curious
to meet the missing links.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she know,&rdquo; asked Silvia, &ldquo;how
Rob regards women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ve always made some excuse to
her for not having them meet. I didn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
want to hear her make disparaging remarks
about him, and she is such a flirt, she&rsquo;d try
to draw him out and he would shut up like
a clam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think,&rdquo; decided Silvia, &ldquo;that the
best way out of it is to write Rob to postpone
his visit and I will write Beth to come
direct to Hope Haven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;that will be fine. She
shall have charge of dear little Di and
study the evolutions of the Polydores later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I approved this plan. So we wrote our
letters and stealthily, but joyously, prepared
for our getaway, leaving the house
like thieves in the night and bearing the
sleeping cherub, Diogenes.</p>
<p>Silvia sighed in relief when we were
aboard the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel quite chesty,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;at
being smart enough to outwit Ptolemy, the
wizard.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I have the feeling,&rdquo; I observed forebodingly,
&ldquo;that they may be on the train
or underneath it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning we reached Windy
Creek, the station nearest our destination,
and continued our journey by stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People will think you have consoled
yourself very speedily for the death of
your first husband,&rdquo; I observed, as we were
en route.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean, Lucien?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Diogenes addresses me as
stepdaddy. It is the only word he speaks
plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed in perturbation,
&ldquo;I never thought of that! Well, we can
explain to everyone, or I&rsquo;ll teach them to
leave off the &lsquo;step.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; I demurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had better call you Lucien, then.
Emerald calls his father &lsquo;Felix.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>She at once began her tutelage of the bewildered
Diogenes. After several stabs at
pronouncing Lucien he managed to evolve
&ldquo;Ocean&rdquo; to which he sometimes affixed
&ldquo;step&rdquo; so that people to whom he was not
explained doubtless thought me the latest
thing in dances.</p>
<p>Hope Haven was like most resorts&ndash;&ndash;a
place safe to shun. There was a low, flat
stretch of woods in which a clearing had
been made for a barn-like structure called
a hotel, with rooms rough and not always
ready. The beautiful recreation grounds
mentioned in the advertising matter consisted
of a plowed field worked over into a
space designated as a tennis court and a
grass-grown croquet ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; claimed Silvia hopefully,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a treat to see woods, water, and sky
unconfined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She devoted the remainder of the morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
to unpacking and after luncheon set
off to explore the woods, borrowing from
the landlady a little cart for Diogenes to
ride in. My plan to go in swimming was
delayed by my garrulous landlord.</p>
<p>I was just starting for the lake when I
heard sounds from the woods that alarmed
the landlord but which I instantly recognized
as the Polydore yell. A moment
later I saw Silvia emerging at full speed
into the open, drawing the cart in which
Diogenes was doubled up like a jackknife.
I hastened to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lucien,&rdquo; exclaimed my wife tearfully,
&ldquo;we are bitten to bits! Just look
at poor little Di!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lifted the howling child from the cart.
His face, neck, and hands were stringy and
purplish&ndash;&ndash;a cross between an eggplant
and a round steak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mosquitoes!&rdquo; explained Silvia. &ldquo;They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
came in flocks and they advertised particularly
&lsquo;no mosquitoes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dour-faced guest paused in passing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;many,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;Very few, in fact, compared to the number
of black flies, sand fleas, and jiggers. However,
you&rsquo;ll find more discomfort from the
poison ivy, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien,&rdquo; began Silvia in lament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; I hastened to console,
&ldquo;you are out of the woods now, and you
won&rsquo;t have to go in again. I presume they
have an antidote up at the house. I&rsquo;ll
give you and Diogenes first aid and then
we will all go down to the lake shore. You
can both sit on the dock and watch me
swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both brightened up, and when we
reached the hotel the landlady provided
a soothing lotion for the bites and stings.</p>
<p>By the time we had started for the lake,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
the afflicted two were in holiday spirit
again.</p>
<p>I sought cover in a small shed called a
bath-house and got into my swimming outfit
and shot out from the dipping end of the
diving-board into the water. When I came
to the surface, Silvia, sitting beside Diogenes
on the dock, shrieked wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lucien, there are snakes all around
you! Come out, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are only water snakes,&rdquo; I assured
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what kind they are. They
are snakes just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diogenes instantly began to bellow for
me to hand him a snake to play with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He recognizes his own,&rdquo; I told Silvia,
who, however, saw nothing amusing in my
implication.</p>
<p>When I came out of the water, the temperature
had climbed several degrees and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
we were glad to seek the hotel parlor, which
was cool and damp.</p>
<p>After dinner Silvia put Diogenes to bed
and we sat out on the veranda. I was enjoying
my evening smoke and the feel of
the night wind in my face. Silvia had just
finished telling me that merely to be away
from the Polydores was Paradise enough
for her, and that she didn&rsquo;t care very much
about the woods, anyway&ndash;&ndash;the lake was
sufficient, when her optimism was rudely
jolted by the shrill, shudder-sending song
of the festive mosquito.</p>
<p>She fled into the parlor. The landlady,
who seemed to have a panacea for all ills,
suggested that she might tack mosquito
netting around the little balcony extending
from our bedroom, and then she could sit
there in comfort when the mosquitoes
bothered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the last lady that had that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
room did,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but when she left,
she took the netting with her. We keep a
supply in our little store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia immediately sought the hotel store
and bought a quantity of the netting and a
goodly stock of the mosquito lotion.</p>
<p>That night as I was drifting into slumber,
Silvia remarked: &ldquo;Only one of the
things I heard and read about this place is
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; I asked between winks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it was unfrequented. I have seen
only three guests besides us so far. How do
they make it pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hotel is evidently only a side issue,&rdquo;
I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the store. Think of the quantities
of lotion and netting they must sell in
the season, which, you must know, is in the
fall. The hunting, the landlord tells me, is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
very good, and his hotel is quite popular in
October and November.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we had better stay, Lucien.
Mosquitoes don&rsquo;t poison you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if they did,&rdquo; I declared, &ldquo;as a
choice between them and the Polydores I
would say, &lsquo;Oh, Mosquito, where is thy
sting?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter VI</span></h2>
<h3><i>A Flirt and a Woman-Hater</i></h3>
</div>
<p>The next morning I arose early and
screened in the little birdhouse balcony.
There was a large piece of
netting left and Silvia converted it into a
robe and headgear for the swaddling of
Diogenes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like the Bride of Lammermoor,&rdquo;
I declared, as he went forth in this
regalia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s preferable to looking like a
pest-house patient, as he did yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>His first-aid costume didn&rsquo;t find favor
with the landlady, as it would seem indicative
to the newly arrived of the features
of the place. However, before another
stage-coming was due, Di had rent
his garment sufficiently to make it useless
is a &ldquo;skeeter skirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the morning I enjoyed my solitary
swim with the snakes. Diogenes
played football with the croquet balls and
bruised one of his toes, besides hitting the
landlady&rsquo;s child in the eye. Silvia went
for a walk which had been pictured in the
advertisements. She speedily returned, her
ardor dampened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are so many sticks and stones
and rocks,&rdquo; she said in a discouraged tone,
&ldquo;that there was no pleasure in walking.
I nearly sprained my ankle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the real sport we haven&rsquo;t tried
yet,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get a boat and take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Diogenes and go for a row on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proposition met with instant favor.
I put Silvia and Diogenes in the stern of the
boat and pulled for the opposite shore. My
endeavors to gain this point were balked by
Silvia&rsquo;s remarkable conceptions of the art
of steering craft. She was so serenely
satisfied, however, with the way she performed
her duties and the aid she thought
she was giving me, that I forbore to
criticize.</p>
<p>In order to achieve a few strokes in the
right direction, I asked her to get me a
cigar from an inside pocket of my coat,
which was on the seat in front of her.
Then came the blight to our bliss. She
looked in the wrong pocket and instead
of producing a cigar, she extracted two
letters with seals unbroken.</p>

<p class='caption'>
&ldquo;Lucien Wade!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Here are our letters to Beth and Rob.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien Wade!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Here
are our letters to Beth and Rob. Well, it
is my fault. I should have known better
than to give them to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plot thickens,&rdquo; I replied thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Monday. They must both be
at the house now. What will they think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will think we didn&rsquo;t receive their
letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it unfortunate&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I am not sure but
what it is a good thing. It will give Rob
a jolt to see that girls can be as nice as Beth
is, and as for her, she is quite able to take
care of the situation where a man is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must have Beth here. Maybe
you&rsquo;d better telegraph her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huldah understands conditions. She
will send Beth on here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning we took Diogenes and
went down the road to meet the stage. As
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
it came around the curve, we saw there
were three passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tolly!&rdquo; cried Diogenes with an ecstatic
whoop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth!&rdquo; recognized Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob!&rdquo; I ejaculated.</p>
<p>The stage stopped to allow us to get in.</p>
<p>Mutual explanations followed. Ours
were brief and substantiated by the documents
in evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I said turning threateningly to
Ptolemy, &ldquo;what did you come here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To show them,&rdquo; indicating Beth and
Rob, &ldquo;how to get here and to look after
Di so you and mudder could enjoy your
vacation,&rdquo; he replied glibly.</p>
<p>Beth laughed mirthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check! Lucien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Huldah warn you,&rdquo; I asked her,
&ldquo;that our whereabouts were to remain unknown?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ptolemy,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;is evidently a
mind reader, for he told me where you were
before I saw Huldah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ptolemy, how did you know where
we were?&rdquo; asked Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was on top of the porch when you
told stepdaddy about coming. I didn&rsquo;t
tell the others. I won&rsquo;t bother you any.
And I know how to look after Di. You
won&rsquo;t send me back, mudder,&rdquo; he pleaded,
looking wistfully at the foam-crested water
of the little lake.</p>
<p>I wondered mutely if Silvia could resist
the appeal in the eyes of the neglected boy
when he turned his imploring gaze to hers,
and the delight depicted in Diogenes&rsquo; eyes
at &ldquo;Tolly&rsquo;s&rdquo; arrival. She could not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may stay as long as we do,&rdquo; she
said slowly, &ldquo;if you are a good boy and will
not play too rough with Diogenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had reached the hotel by this time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
and with a wild &ldquo;ki yi&rdquo; Ptolemy dashed
for the shore, dragging the delighted Diogenes
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only fair to Huldah to take one
more off her hands,&rdquo; Silvia said apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them Three is what bothers me,&rdquo; I
complained. &ldquo;If they, too, follow after,
Heaven help them! I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good arrangement all around,&rdquo;
declared Rob. &ldquo;I judge it takes a Polydore
to understand his ilk, so the kids can pair
off together. Miss Wade will be company
for you, while Lucien and I go fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked keenly at Beth as he spoke,
but Beth was looking demurely down and
made no sign of having heard him.</p>
<p>Silvia and I went with Beth to her room,
and then she told her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing Lucien&rsquo;s failing, I was not
surprised at receiving no response to my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
letter. When I got out of the cab in front
of your house, a wild-looking boy, very bas-relief
as to eyes, and who I felt sure must
be Ptolemy of the Polydores, appeared.
As soon as he saw me he gave utterance
to a blood-curdling yell of&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;Here she
is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In response to his call three of his understudies
came on with headlong greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are Beth, aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; Ptolemy
asked me. Then he drew me aside and in
mysterious whispers told me where you
were and that you had written me to join
you here. He added that stepdaddy never
remembered to mail letters. I went within
and interviewed Huldah who confirmed
his information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently I saw a taxi stop before the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rsquo; exclaimed Ptolemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Him who?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Rob somebody&ndash;&ndash;stepdaddy&rsquo;s college
chum. He wrote he was coming, and they
thought they had postponed him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a sprint of speed the four Polydores
surrounded your Mr. Rossiter, all
talking at once. I came to the rescue, of
course, and explained the situation, and we
decided to follow you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptolemy was promoter for the trip and
suggested the advisability of his accompanying
us as courier and future nursemaid to
Diogenes. He was intending to come anyway,
but thought he&rsquo;d wait for us. He
had all his belongings packed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t many except those he had
on,&rdquo; said Silvia thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has some swimming trunks, two
collars, two shirts, some mismated socks,
homemade fishing tackle and a battered
baseball bat. We came away surreptitiously
to escape detection by the trio left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
behind. I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t welcome
his presence&ndash;&ndash;but he said he was coming
anyway, so we thought we might as well
bring him and express him back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After visiting with Beth for a few moments,
Silvia and I withdrew to talk matters
over confidentially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well,&rdquo; I quoth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t ended yet,&rdquo; reminded Silvia.
&ldquo;I trust Ptolemy didn&rsquo;t reveal what you
said about Rob&rsquo;s being a woman-hater and
Beth a flirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ptolemy conveniently appeared just then,
as he generally did in the midst of private
interviews. Silvia asked him if he had
repeated those remarks to Beth or Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew you didn&rsquo;t
want her to know, because stepdaddy said
so, and I thought he wouldn&rsquo;t like to be
called that, and I wasn&rsquo;t going to give Beth
away to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Ptolemy!&rdquo; I exclaimed,
for the first time awarding him
approbation.</p>
<p>Out on the veranda we met Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, those Polydores certainly have
the punch and pep,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to have fetched the whole bunch along
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had,&rdquo; I replied dryly, &ldquo;our life&rsquo;s
friendship would have died on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><i>In Which Nothing Much Happens</i></h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why Hope Haven?&rdquo; asked Rob
reflectively, when he had taken
inventory of the possibilities
of the resort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; sighed Silvia, &ldquo;so many
hopes&ndash;&ndash;vacation hopes&ndash;&ndash;must have been
buried here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob was of an investigating turn of
mind, however, and he had heard from a
native of H. H., as he had abbreviated the
place, that there was a smaller lake, abounding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
in fish, farther on through the forest.
It was so strongly fortified, however, by
the formidable battalions of sharp-shooting
insects that but few fishermen had ever
been able to lay siege to it.</p>
<p>Rob and I being poison proof decided to
try our luck and pitch camp for a few days
on the shores of this hidden treasure. As
we had to send to town by the stage driver
for the necessary supplies, we remained in
H. H. the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>We at once paired off in Noah&rsquo;s most
approved style as Rob had outlined. Beth
and Ptolemy went up shore, sticks and
stones and rocks being no obstacles to their
feet. Rob and I sought the society of the
snakes, while Silvia and Diogenes, mosquito-netted,
watched a game of croquet.</p>
<p>We dined without the pleasure of the
society of Ptolemy and Diogenes, who had
been invited to sit at the table with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
landlady&rsquo;s children. I might state, incidentally,
that the invitation was never
repeated.</p>
<p>Beth was quite excited over her walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptolemy and I,&rdquo; she boasted, &ldquo;made
more of a discovery than Mr. Rossiter did.
We found a haunted house, a perfectly
haunted house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not surprised,&rdquo; declared Silvia.
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t expect any other kind of a
house in such a region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;and what is
it haunted by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insects,&rdquo; suggested Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go around shore about two miles,
only it&rsquo;s farther, as you have to make so
many ups and downs over the rocks. Then
you leave the shore and go through a
low marshy stretch, sort of a Dismal
Swamp, and then up a hill. After Ptolemy
and I climbed to the top, we looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
down and saw, hidden in a clump of lonely
looking poplars, a small, rudely built house.
We went down to explore and had hard
work making our way through a thick
growth of&ndash;&ndash;everything. We crawled
under some tangled vines and came up
on the steps. The house was vacant, although
there were a few old pieces of
furniture&ndash;&ndash;a couple of cots, a cook-stove,
table, and chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On our way home we met a woman
who gave us a history of the house. An
old miser lived there long ago. One night
he was robbed and murdered, and his
ghost still haunts the place. No one
ventures in its vicinity, and she said most
likely we were the first people who had
gone there since the tragedy. She told
us of a nearer way to reach it. You take
the road to Windy Creek, and about two
miles below here, turn into a lane and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
then go through a grove and over a
hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really believe the story, that
is, the ghost part of it?&rdquo; asked Rossiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&ndash;&ndash;o,&rdquo; allowed Beth. &ldquo;Still, I&rsquo;d like
to. It makes it interesting. Ptolemy and
I are going down there some night to see
if we can find the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see one,&rdquo; I assured her.
&ldquo;Ptolemy&rsquo;s presence would be sufficient
to keep even a ghost in the background.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptolemy&rsquo;s a peach,&rdquo; declared Beth
emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were older, you wouldn&rsquo;t think
so,&rdquo; said Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Beth in surprise,
or seeming surprise.</p>
<p>He smiled enigmatically, and irrelevantly
asked her if she wouldn&rsquo;t really be afraid
to go to the haunted house at night with
only Ptolemy for protection.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>She assured him she shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid
of a ghost if she saw one, and that she
shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to go alone.</p>
<p>Throughout the evening, which we
spent in rowing, walking, and later at a
little impromptu supper, I was interested
in observing the puzzling behavior of Beth
and my chum. I had expected that he
would avoid her as much as possible and
speak to her only when common politeness
made conversation obligatory, and
that she, a born coquette, would seek to
add his scalp to her collection. Instead,
to my surprise, their r&ocirc;les were reversed.
He appeared interested in her every remark
and looked at her often and intently.
He was quite assiduous in his attentions
which, strange to say, she discouraged,
not with the deep design of a flirt to increase
his ardor, but with a calm firmness
that admitted of no doubt as to her feelings.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Your sister,&rdquo; he remarked to me as
we were walking down to the lake for a
swim just before going to bed, &ldquo;is a very
unusual type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; I assured him. &ldquo;Beth is
the true feminine type which you have
never taken the trouble to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, Lucien! Not feminine,
you know. Though she is inconsistent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I resented the imputation hotly, but he
only laughed and said that he guessed it
was true that a man didn&rsquo;t understand the
women in his family as well as an outsider
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;just because she
says she isn&rsquo;t afraid of ghosts&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he denied. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t
the reason, but&ndash;&ndash;I like her type, though
I always supposed I wouldn&rsquo;t. It is a
new one to me&ndash;&ndash;anyway. I didn&rsquo;t
think so young a girl as she&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>Our discussion was cut short by the
inevitable, ever-present Ptolemy, who
came running up to us, clad in about four
inches of swimming trunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you in bed?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in bed, but it was so warm I
couldn&rsquo;t sleep, and I went to the window
and saw you coming down here, so I thought
I&rsquo;d come, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I repeated Rob&rsquo;s remarks to Silvia when
I returned to our room, and she betrayed
Beth&rsquo;s confidences in regard to Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she would like him if it were
not for one trait that she dislikes more
than any other in a man and that it was
sufficient in her estimation to counterbalance
all his good qualities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can she mean?&rdquo; I asked bewildered.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a flaw in Rob,
except for his being a woman-hater, and
he surely hasn&rsquo;t betrayed that fact to her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
judging from his manner toward her. I
think he is making an effort to be nice to
her on my account, and she doesn&rsquo;t appreciate
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked her what the flaw was, and she
flushed and said she couldn&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess all around it is a good
thing we are going off on our fishing expedition.
I don&rsquo;t want my friend turned
down by my sister, and I don&rsquo;t want my
friend calling my sister a new type and
unfeminine.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class='smcaplc'>CHAPTER VIII</span></h2>
<h3><i>Ptolemy Disappears and I Visit a Haunted House</i></h3>
</div>
<p>When Rob and I, with our camping
outfit, drove off through the
woods, Ptolemy&rsquo;s eyes followed
us so enviously and he pleaded so eloquently
to be taken with us that Rob
was actually on the point of considering
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Rob Rossiter!&rdquo; I exclaimed,
&ldquo;This is my vacation and all I came to
this God-forsaken place for was to escape
the Polydores. If he goes, I stay. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
know I&rsquo;ve always tried to meet issues,
but this antique family has got me going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he yielded.</p>
<p>After a drive of a few miles we came
to the lake and pitched our tent. Two
days of ideal camp life followed. The
weather was fine, Rob was a first-class
cook, and the sport was beyond our most
optimistic expectation. We landed enough
of the Friday food to satisfy the most
fastidious fishing fiend, and the mosquitoes,
finding we were impervious to their
stings, finally let us alone.</p>
<p>I forgot all business cares and disappointments,
yes, even the Polydores; but on
the morning of the third day Rob began
to show signs of restlessness and spoke
of the likelihood of my wife&rsquo;s being lonely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with Beth and Ptolemy in calling
distance,&rdquo; I told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will be off together,&rdquo; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
replied, &ldquo;and your wife will be alone with
that <i>enfant terrible</i>. I fancy, too, that
your sister isn&rsquo;t exactly a companion for
your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that shows how little you know
her. She and Silvia are great friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course they are friendly,
but I mean their tastes are so different,
and they are so unlike. Your sister doesn&rsquo;t
care for domesticity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure she does. You have turned the
wrong searchlight on Beth. If you knew
her, you&rsquo;d like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do like her,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
bad she&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly and quickly
changed the conversation. In spite of
my efforts to renew the controversy about
Beth, he refused to return to the subject.</p>

<p class='caption'>
He pleaded eloquently to be taken with us.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>In the afternoon, when I was doing a
little scale work preparatory to cooking,
a messenger from the hotel drove up with
a note from Silvia which I read aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptolemy has been missing for twenty-four
hours. We are in hopes he has
joined you. If not, what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back with you,&rdquo; said Rob to
the man. &ldquo;Just lend a hand here and
help us pull up these tent stakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Ptolemy to me or I to him?&rdquo;
I asked with a groan, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we give him
absent treatment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re positively inhuman, Lucien,&rdquo;
protested Rob. &ldquo;The boy may be at
the bottom of the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he! He was born to be hung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time, however, I had been active
in making preparations for departure, as
I knew that Silvia would feel that we were
responsible for Ptolemy&rsquo;s safety, and her
anxiety was reason enough for me to hasten
to her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>Rob was quite jubilant on our return trip
and declared that the fish came too easily
and too plentifully to make it real sport,
but I felt that I had another grudge to be
charged up to the fateful family.</p>
<p>We found Silvia pale from anxiety, Beth
in tears, and Diogenes loudly clamoring for
&ldquo;Tolly.&rdquo; We learned that the afternoon
before, Silvia and Beth had gone with the
landlady for a ride, leaving Diogenes in
Ptolemy&rsquo;s care, but on their return at
dinner time, Diogenes was playing alone
in the sandpile.</p>
<p>Nothing was thought of Ptolemy&rsquo;s absence
until bedtime, and they had then
sent out searching parties to the woods
and the lake shores. Finally it occurred
to Beth that he might have gone to join
Rob and me, so they sent the messenger
to investigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be lost in the woods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
somewhere,&rdquo; said Beth tearfully, &ldquo;and he will
starve to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob actually touched her hand in his
distress at her grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptolemy is too smart to get lost anywhere,&rdquo;
I declared. &ldquo;He knows fully as
much about woodcraft as he does about
every other kind of craft. He&rsquo;s one of
his mother&rsquo;s antiquities personified. But
haven&rsquo;t you been able to find anyone who
saw him after you went for your ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; even the hotel help were all out
on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he left Diogenes here, absolutely
unguarded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; admitted Silvia, &ldquo;he tied Diogenes
to a tree near the sandpile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he must have gone away with
malice aforethought,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and Diogenes
is the only one who knows anything
about his last movements.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>I lifted the child to my knee, and speaking
more gently to him than I had ever
done, I asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Di, did you and Tolly play in the
sandpile yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was quite emphatic in his affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell Ocean: Did Tolly go away
and leave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tolly goed away,&rdquo; he confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lucien!&rdquo; protested Beth, laughing.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too little to know what you are
talking about or to remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien&rsquo;s ruling passion strong in death,&rdquo;
murmured Rob. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t help cross-examining
the cradle even!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way,&rdquo; I resumed, ignoring these
interruptions, &ldquo;did Tolly go&ndash;&ndash;that way?&rdquo;
pointing towards the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Tolly goed&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and he trailed off
into his baby jargon which no one could
understand, but he pointed to the lake.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say when he went away;
when he tied the rope around you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diogenes&rsquo; intentions to be communicative
were certainly all right, but not a
word was intelligible. As he kept picking
at his dress and pointing to it, I finally
prompted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Tolly pin a paper to Di&rsquo;s dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;h&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Lucien!&rdquo; applauded Rob.
&ldquo;They say you can induce a witness to
admit anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Di do with the paper?&rdquo; I
continued.</p>
<p>The word he wanted evidently being
beyond his vocabulary and speech, he
made a rotary motion with his fist. The
gesture conveyed nothing to our minds,
but was instantly recognized and interpreted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
by the landlady&rsquo;s little girl, who
said he meant a windmill such as she had
sometimes made for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Di do with the windmill?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>He pointed to the sandpile, which I
investigated and found a stick planted
therein. I pulled it up and saw a pin
sticking in the end of it. Further excavation
revealed a crumpled piece of paper
on which was written in Ptolemy&rsquo;s round
hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see kids. Am going home.
Tell Beth I bet she dasent go to the haunted
house alone at night. Ptolemy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Huldah!&rdquo; sighed Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he was having the time of
his life here,&rdquo; said Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was sore,&rdquo; declared Beth, &ldquo;because
you and Lucien wouldn&rsquo;t take him with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
you on the fishing trip. He was moping
by himself all the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to think up some new deviltry,&rdquo;
I theorized, &ldquo;to make us feel bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; asserted Silvia, &ldquo;I think he really
misses the boys. The Polydores, for all
their scrappings, are very clannish. But
how do you suppose he got down to Windy
Creek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could catch plenty of rides along
the way, but what is puzzling me is how
he got the money to pay his fare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed very well provided with
cash,&rdquo; informed Rob. &ldquo;I tried to pay
for his ticket down here, but he insisted
on buying it himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia worried so much about what
might happen to him en route that after
dinner I motored to Windy Creek with
some tourists who had stopped at the
hotel in passing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>I called up long distance and after some
delay got in communication with our house.
Ptolemy himself answered and assured me
he had arrived all &ldquo;hunky doory&rdquo;, that
Huldah, who was out on an errand, was
&ldquo;hunky doory&rdquo;, and that the kids were
all &ldquo;hunky doory.&rdquo; In fact, his cheerful
tone indicated that the whole universe
was in the beatific state described by his
expressive adjective.</p>
<p>I was really ripping mad at his taking
French leave and so giving Silvia cause
for her anxiety, but I forbore to reprimand
him by word or tone, lest he get even by
&ldquo;coming back&rdquo; literally. I did tell him
how the loss of the note for twenty-four
hours had caused a general excitement,
but he felt no remorse for his share in the
situation, blaming Diogenes entirely and
bidding me &ldquo;punch the kid&rsquo;s face&rdquo; for
unpinning the note.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>On my return from Windy Creek I was
fortunate enough to fall in with a farmer
who lived near the hotel. He was driving
some sort of a machine he called an <i>autoo</i>.
He was an old-timer in the vicinity and
related the past, present, and pluperfect of
all the residents on the route. I had a
detailed and vivid account of the midnight
visitor of the haunted house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d jest naturally like to see what there
is to it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not that I am afeerd
at all, only it&rsquo;s sort of spooky to go to a
lonesome place like that all alone. If I
could git some one to go with me, I&rsquo;d tackle
the job, but I vum if every time I perpose
it to anyone they don&rsquo;t make some excuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dread
ghosts near as much as I do some living
folks I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you air,&rdquo; chuckled the old man.
&ldquo;If you say so we&rsquo;ll go right off now jest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
as sure as shootin&rsquo;. We may be ghosts
ourselves tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured him I was quite ready to encounter
the ghost, so he jubilantly turned
the machine from the road into a grass-grown
lane. We zigzagged for some distance
and then got out and went on foot
through a grove. The moon and the stars
were half veiled by some light, misty clouds,
so that the little house didn&rsquo;t show up
very clearly, but as we came to the top
of the hill, we saw something that shook
even my well-behaved nerves.</p>
<p>From a window in the roof-room extended
a white arm and hand, with index
finger pointing threateningly and directly
toward us.</p>
<p>My farmer friend turned quickly and
fled toward the grove. I followed fleetly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your rush?&rdquo; I asked, when I
had overtaken him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I just happened to remember,&rdquo; he explained
gaspingly, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s a pesky
autoo thief in these &rsquo;ere parts. Bukins
had his stole jest last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lights on his machine must have
reassured him as to its safety when we
emerged from the woods into the open, but
he didn&rsquo;t lessen his speed. We got in the
&ldquo;autoo&rdquo; and soon said good-by to the
lane. At one time I believed it was
good-by to everything, but at last we
gained the highway, right side up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I said, when we were running
normally again on terra firma, &ldquo;that
was some little old ghost,&ndash;&ndash;beckoned to
us to come right in, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seen it then!&rdquo; he exclaimed excitedly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad I had an eyewitness.
Folks wouldn&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They probably won&rsquo;t believe me,
either,&rdquo; I assured him. &ldquo;I am a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me! Well, it did jest
give me a start for a minute. I&rsquo;d like to
hev gone in and seen it nigh to, if I hadn&rsquo;t
happened to think of this &rsquo;ere autoo. You
see I ain&rsquo;t got it all paid for yet. I&rsquo;m jest
clean beat. You don&rsquo;t mind my takin&rsquo;
a leetle pull at a stone fence, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; I assented somewhat
dubiously, however. &ldquo;That was a rail
fence we took a pull at back in the lane,
wasn&rsquo;t it? Of course, if we shouldn&rsquo;t
happen to clear the stone fence as well
as we did the rail fence, it might be more
disastrous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, land!&rdquo; he said with a cackling
laugh, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t meanin&rsquo; that kind of a
fence. I mean the kind you&ndash;&ndash;Say!
You ain&rsquo;t one of them teetotalers, be you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in theory,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but this
stone fence drink is a new one on me.
What&rsquo;s it like?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>He stopped the &ldquo;autoo&rdquo; and pulled a
bottle from an inner pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kin taste it better than I kin tell
it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Take a pull&ndash;&ndash;a condumned
good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rarely imbibed, confining my indulgences
to the demands of necessity, but I
thought that the flight of Ptolemy, the
ghostly encounter, and my Mazeppa&ndash;&ndash;wild
ride all combined to constitute an occasion
adequate to call for a bracer in the shape
of a stone fence, or anything he might
produce.</p>
<p>I took what I considered a &ldquo;condumned
good one&rdquo; from the bottle and it nearly
strangled me, but I followed the aged
stranger&rsquo;s advice to take another to &ldquo;cure
the chokes&rdquo; caused by the first one. On
general principles I took a third and then
reluctantly returned him the bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s over the moon,&rdquo; he jovially
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
exclaimed as he proceeded to make my
attempt at a &ldquo;condumned good one&rdquo;
appear most niggardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; I inquired when my feeling
of nerve-tense strain had vanished, and
I felt as if I were treading thin air, &ldquo;just
what is in a stone fence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think?&rdquo; he asked
slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the very devil is in it,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mebby,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
two-thirds hard cider and one-third whisky.
It&rsquo;s a healthy, hearting drink and yet
it has a leetle come back to it&ndash;&ndash;a sort
o&rsquo; kick, you know. But this is where I
live,&rdquo; pointing to a farmhouse well back
from the road, &ldquo;but I am goin&rsquo; to run you
on to your tavern though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hotel was dark, save for a light in
my room. I invited him in, but he was
anxious to &ldquo;git hum and tell the folks&rdquo;,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
so I gave him some cigars and went in to
&ldquo;tell my folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found them in the room waiting for
me. That is, Beth was in the room, sitting
by the table and pretending to read. Silvia
and Rob were out in the little balcony.
They came inside as soon as they heard my
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, was he there?&rdquo; asked Silvia anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;He answered the
telephone himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was feeling quite exhilarated by this
time. My wife looked a perfect vision to
me. Beth, I thought, was some sister,
and Rob the best fellow in the world. Even
the Polydores at long range, and under
the ameliorating influence of stone fences,
seemed like fine little fellows&ndash;&ndash;rather active
and strenuous, to be sure, but only as
all wholesome children should be.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>Silvia was relieved at the announcement
of Ptolemy&rsquo;s safety, but very much disappointed
that I did not succeed in interviewing
Huldah and finding out something
about domestic affairs.</p>
<p>I assured her that everything was &ldquo;hunky
doory&rdquo; at home, praised the telephone
service, my expedition to town, and painted
my return ride with &ldquo;the honest farmer&rdquo;
in glowing terms. I was suddenly halted in
my eulogy by becoming aware of an amazed
expression on my wife&rsquo;s countenance, a
most suspicious glance in Beth&rsquo;s wide-open
eyes, and a very knowing wink from
Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien,&rdquo; said Silvia severely, &ldquo;I believe
you&rsquo;ve been drinking. I certainly
smell spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you do,&rdquo; I replied jocosely.
&ldquo;I certainly saw spirits. I went to the
haunted house on my way back.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Windy Creek was a dry
town,&rdquo; remarked Rob innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; I assured him, &ldquo;but I rode home
with an old man&ndash;&ndash;a farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he run a blind pig?&rdquo; asked Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was more like a pig in a poke,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien,&rdquo; exclaimed Silvia reproachfully,
&ldquo;you told me two years ago, after
that banquet to the Bar, that you were
never going to touch wine or whisky again.
What did that horrid old man give you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stone fence. That&rsquo;s what he said
it was anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new one on me,&rdquo; commented
Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a new toast went with it.
He drank to &lsquo;over the moon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have gone there all right and
taken all the shine from the moon-man,&rdquo;
said Rob.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien,&rdquo; asked Beth, &ldquo;did you really
go to that haunted house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I was moved to eloquence, and I
told of the farmer&rsquo;s yearning, the fulfillment,
the beckoning hand and the beating
of the retreat at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; asked Rob, &ldquo;that you
didn&rsquo;t take that stone fence before you
visited the haunted house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I replied, loftily, &ldquo;that a
lawyer&rsquo;s word is worthless, but seeing is
believing. We will all visit the haunted
house tomorrow night and I&rsquo;ll make good
on ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan was unanimously approved,
and then Silvia suggested that she thought
I had better go to bed. I had no particular
objection to doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien,&rdquo; she said solemnly, when we
were alone, &ldquo;I want you to promise me
something. I want you to give me your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
word that you will never take another
stone wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did this most readily.</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter IX</span></h2>
<h3><i>In Which We See Ghosts</i></h3>
</div>
<p>The next morning Rob tried earnestly
and vainly to drive a wedge in
Beth&rsquo;s good graces, but she treated
him with a casual tolerance that finally
put him in an ill humor which he took out
on me with many a gibe at my &ldquo;stone fence
spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men of my profession who have to deal
with facts rather than fancy are not believers
in the supernatural. I was sure
that the extending arm and the beckoning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
finger were there, but belonged to no
ghost. It might have been a curtain
blowing out the window or a fake of some
kind. But I knew that unless there was
some kind of a showing in a ghostly way
that night, I should never hear the last of
my stone fence indulgence, so I resolved
to make a preliminary visit alone by daylight
and rig up something white to substantiate
my spectral narrative.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t find an opportunity to escape
unseen until late in the afternoon, when I
went, ostensibly, for a solitary row on the
lake.</p>
<p>I landed and came by a circuitous route
to the haunted house. The calm security
of sunshine, of course, prevented any shivers
of anticipation such as I had experienced
the night before. On passing one of the
windows on my way to the front entrance,
I glanced in, stopped in sheer fright, stooped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
and backed to the next window, which was
screened by a labyrinth of vines through
which I peered. I am sure I lost my Bloom
of Youth complexion for a few moments.
I babbled aimlessly to myself and then
managed to pull together and beat it to
the lake with as much speed as my farmer
friend had shown in his retreat. I made the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
boat and the hotel in double quick time.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_20' id='linki_20'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-025.jpg' alt='' title='' width='324' height='296' /><br />
</div>
<p>I felt no misgivings now as to the promise
of a sensation that night, and that sustaining
thought was all that propped my flagging
spirits throughout the day, but I
resolved to keep my little party at safe
distance from the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say we keep our nocturnal noctambulation
under our hats,&rdquo; proposed Rob.</p>
<p>When this proposition was translated to
Silvia, she entirely approved, so, committing
Diogenes to the Polydores&rsquo; Providence, we
left the hotel at half past eleven for a row
on the lake by moonlight.</p>
<p>When we descended the slope leading
to the House of Mystery, I cautioned silence
and a &ldquo;safety-first&rdquo; distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts are easily vanished,&rdquo; I informed
them. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seek limelight,
and I want you to be sure to see
this one.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>As we came to the untrodden undergrowth
we heard a weird, wailing sound
that would have curdled my blood had I
not glanced in the window that afternoon
and so, in a measure, been prepared for
this&ndash;&ndash;or anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; whispered Beth. &ldquo;The arm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia looked at the roof window and with
a stifled shriek of terror turned and fled up
the hill, Rob chivalrously pursuing her.</p>
<p>Beth was pale, but game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be, Lucien?&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Do we dare go in to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t, Beth,&rdquo; I vetoed quickly.
&ldquo;Maybe some lunatic or half-witted person
has taken up abode here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien!&rdquo; called Rob peremptorily.</p>
<p>I turned quickly. He was at the top of
the hill, half supporting Silvia. I ran
toward them, followed by Beth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a ghost, of course, Silvia,&rdquo; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
said soothingly, and then repeated my supposition
about the lunatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts,&rdquo;
said Silvia shudderingly, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s an awful
place and those sounds are like those I
have heard in nightmares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hurry back to the hotel and forget
all about it,&rdquo; I urged.</p>
<p>I rowed the boat and Silvia sat opposite
me. Beth and Rob were in the stern
and I had to listen to their conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I felt a little creepy,&rdquo; she admitted,
&ldquo;but then I like to feel that way,
and I wasn&rsquo;t afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course, you wouldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he
replied somewhat ironically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the
new woman type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; she denied. &ldquo;I wish
I were. Silvia&rsquo;s really the strong-minded
type.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t act the part when she saw
the ghost,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unusual for her nerves to give
way. Silvia&rsquo;s quite a surprise to me this
summer, but I think those funny Polydores
have upset her more than Lucien realizes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered if she were right, and once
again murderous wishes toward the Polydores
entered my brain, and I made renewed
vows about disposing of them on
our return home.</p>
<p>One thing, however, had been accomplished
by our expedition. Silvia was more
lenient in her judgment on my indulgences
of the preceding night.</p>
<p>By the time we pulled in at the landing,
Silvia had recovered her equilibrium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien, what the devil do you suppose
was in that house?&rdquo; asked Rob, when we
were putting up the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loons and things,&rdquo; I allowed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But what was that white arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fake thing the village wag has
put up to scare the natives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning&rsquo;s stage brought some new
arrivals, and among them were two college
students who at once were claimed by Beth.
She played tennis with one and later went
rowing with the other. Rob smoked and
sulked, apart.</p>
<p>My farmer friend had been garrulous
and rumors of the ghost and the haunted
house had come to the ears of the hotel
inmates, thereby causing a pleasurable
stir of excitement. A number of them
announced their intention of visiting the
place. They asked me to be their guide,
but I refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was interesting,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I think
it would be a bore to see the same ghost
twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t care to go again,&rdquo; was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Silvia&rsquo;s emphatic reply when asked to be
one of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts are scientifically admitted and
explained,&rdquo; growled Rob, &ldquo;so I don&rsquo;t see
anything to be excited about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth accepted the offer of escort of one
of the students, so Silvia, Rob, and I remained
at home. The night was quite
cool, and we played cards in our room.
When the party returned, Beth joined us.
She looked rather out of sorts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she replied in answer to
Silvia&rsquo;s eager inquiry. &ldquo;We saw the ghost.
I don&rsquo;t know whether it was the same
little old last night&rsquo;s ghost or a new one.
He showed more of himself this time though.
He had two arms and a veiled head out of
the window. As soon as our crowd glimpsed
it, they all fled quicker than we did last
night. Those two students fell all over
each other and left me in the lurch.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What could you expect,&rdquo; asked Rob,
&ldquo;from such ladylike things? They ought
to be kept in the confines of the croquet
ground. If they are a fair specimen of
the kind you have met, no wonder you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class='figtag'>

</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-026.jpg' alt='' title='' width='309' height='287' /><br />
</div>
<p>He stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder what?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied glumly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>When I came down to breakfast the
next morning, the landlady in tears waylaid
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Wade,&rdquo; she began in trouble-telling
tone, &ldquo;this affair about the ghost is
going to hurt my business. Some of those
folks say they are going home, and they
will tell others and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix the ghost story. Just leave it to
me!&rdquo; I assured her optimistically, as we
went into the dining-room.</p>
<p>There were only enough guests to fill one
long table, and every one was excitedly
dissecting the ghost.</p>
<p>I took my seat and also the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to dispel your illusions,&rdquo; I said
cheerfully, &ldquo;but the fact is, I made a daylight
investigation of the haunted house.
First I looked in the window and I saw&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what did you see?&rdquo; chorused a
dozen or more expectant voices.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of&ndash;&ndash;mice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; came in disappointed and skeptical
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, the ghost, Mr. Wade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! The arms and the head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fake figure put up by some practical
joker for the purpose of frightening timid
people and encouraging the credulous. I
didn&rsquo;t want to spoil your little picnic, so
I kept still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those sounds, Lucien!&rdquo; reminded
Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were from a cat chorus. They were
prowling about the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure some lawyer, Mr. Wade,&rdquo;
doubtfully complimented my grateful landlady,
as we went out of the room after
breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien,&rdquo; asked Rob <i>sotto voce</i>, joining
me on the veranda, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t the cats
you speak of catch that lot of mice?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>Fortunately Beth came up to us, and I
didn&rsquo;t have to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said with a shudder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
never go near that awful place! I&rsquo;d rather
see a perfectly good ghost, or a loon, or a
lunatic any day than a mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re surely not afraid of a mouse!&rdquo;
exclaimed Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked coolly as she
walked on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you she was feminine,&rdquo; I reminded
him.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;why
a girl who is afraid of mice should be&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand anything about
women,&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Lucien. I don&rsquo;t, but
your sister is surely the greatest enigma of
them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rented the stone fence farmer&rsquo;s &ldquo;autoo&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
and took Silvia and Diogenes to a neighboring
town that afternoon. We didn&rsquo;t
get back to the hotel until dinner time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been up to all day,
Rob?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Numerous things. For one, I strolled
down to the haunted house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; cried the women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw four&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts?&rdquo; asked Beth.</p>
<p>I shot him a warning glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young tomcats playing tag with the
mice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I corralled Rob outside after dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; I implored.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb Silvia&rsquo;s peace of mind.
Did you go inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I was sorely tempted to, but refrained
out of deference to the evident
wishes of my host, but really, Lucien, we
should&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I have only ten more days off, Rob.
Don&rsquo;t make any unpleasant suggestions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said promptly.</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter</span> X</h2>
<h3><i>In Which We Make Some Discoveries</i></h3>
</div>
<p>Diogenes, who, for a Polydore, had
been quite placid since Ptolemy&rsquo;s
departure, caused a commotion
by disappearing the next morning. As he
was possessed of a deep desire to go in the
lake and get a little snake, he had been,
when not under strict surveillance, tied to
a tree with enough leeway in the length of
rope to allow him to play comfortably.</p>
<p>By some means he had managed to work
himself loose from the rope and had evidently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
followed Ptolemy&rsquo;s example. I suggested
calling up Huldah and asking if he
had arrived yet, but I met with such chilling
glances from Silvia and Beth that I got
busy and organized searching parties, who
reluctantly and lukewarmly engaged in the
pursuit. Rob and I took the shore. After
we had walked some little distance, we
met a woman and stopped for inquiry.
She said she had seen a child of about two
years, clad in a blue and white striped dress
and a big hat, going over the hill in company
with a boy of about eight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going on to the hotel?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>On her replying that she was, I told her
to inform them that she had met me and
that the lost child was located.</p>
<p>Rob and I then kept on over the hill, and
when we neared the haunted house, we
heard hair-raising sounds.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been here before,&rdquo; remarked
Rob, &ldquo;I should think that Sitting Bull had
been reincarnated and was reviving the
warrior war whoops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We paused on the threshold. A human
windmill of whirling legs and arms&ndash;&ndash;Polydore
legs and arms&ndash;&ndash;flashed before our
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; I thundered.</p>
<p>The flying wheel of arms and legs slacked,
ran a few times, then slowly stopped, and
the Polydore quintette assumed normal
positions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa, stepdaddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A landslide composed of Emerald, Pythagoras,
and Demetrius started toward
me. I side-stepped and let Rob receive
the charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Line them up now, for attention,&rdquo; I
directed Ptolemy. &ldquo;I have something to
say to you all.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>Ptolemy knocked the three terrors up
against the wall, and I picked up Diogenes,
who had a bump as big as an egg on his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; said Ptolemy to Pythagoras,
&ldquo;that if you brought Di down here
they&rsquo;d get on our trail. He wanted to see
Di,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;so he sneaked over
there and got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were wise before today,&rdquo; I informed
him. &ldquo;I saw you all day before
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I discovered you yesterday,&rdquo; added
Rob.</p>
<p>Ptolemy looked rather crestfallen, and
then, seeming to consider that my discovery
had been succeeded by inaction, which must
mean non-interference, he heartened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;I want you to
begin at the time you left the hotel and tell
me everything and why you did it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t having any fun after you two
went off camping,&rdquo; he began lugubriously.
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t hang around women folks all
the time. I wanted boys to play with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw a gleam of sympathy and understanding
come into Rob&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A harem of hens,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew we could all have a grand time
here and not be a bother to mudder, or
Huldah or anyone, and it seemed too bad
for this nice house to be empty, and no
one anywhere else wanting us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt my first gleam of pity for a Polydore
and wiped Diogenes&rsquo; dirty, moist face
carefully with my handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I went home and told Huldah I had
come after the boys to take them back
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And told her we had sent for them?&rdquo;
I asked sharply.</p>
<p>He flushed slightly at my tone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t tell her so. She got that
idea herself, and I didn&rsquo;t tell her different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came the same night that you telephoned,
and took the train you and mudder
came on. We got to Windy Creek in the
morning. We fetched all our stuff here
from home. I bought it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;tell me where you
got the money to buy your stuff and to pay
your fare here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cashed father&rsquo;s check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he left you one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t, except the one he gave me
to give you for our board. You told
mudder you wouldn&rsquo;t touch it, and it seemed
a pity not to have it working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visions of a future Polydore doing the
chain and ball step flashed before my vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they cashed it for you at the
bank?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Father always has me cash his
checks for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What amount did you fill in?&rdquo; I asked
enviously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred dollars. There&rsquo;s a lot
more in the bank, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get your truck here
from Windy Creek?&rdquo; asked Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We divided it up and each took a
bunch and started on foot, and some people
in an automobile, going to the town past
here, took us in and brought us as far
as the lane. We&rsquo;ve been having a fine
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doing?&rdquo; asked Rob interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fishing, sailing on a raft, playing in
the woods all day and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing ghost at night,&rdquo; said Pythagoras
with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who made that ghost in the window?&rdquo;
I demanded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I did. I rigged up an arm and put it
out the window the afternoon I left, hoping
Beth would come down and see it, but
we&rsquo;ve got a jim dandy one now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was quite a shapely arm,&rdquo; said
Rob. &ldquo;Where did you learn sculpturing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I rigged it up,&rdquo; he said casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you bring in the way of
supplies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bacon, crackers, beans, candy, popcorn,
gum, peanuts, pickles, candles, matches,
and butter,&rdquo; was the glib inventory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may stay here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;until we
go home, but you are not to stir away from
the woods about here and not on any
account to come near the hotel, or let it
be known that you are here. And you are
to end this ghost business right off. Now,
Di, we&rsquo;ll go home to mudder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; bawled Di. &ldquo;Stay with boys.
Mudder come here.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>At least this was Ptolemy&rsquo;s interpretation
of his protest.</p>
<p>I threatened, Rob coaxed, and Ptolemy
cuffed, but every time I started to leave
and jerk him after me, he uttered such
demoniac yells I was forced to stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish it was night,&rdquo; said Emerald
regretfully. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he scare folks
though! How does he get his voice up so
high?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little Di!&rdquo; said a voice commiseratingly
from the doorway. &ldquo;Was
Ocean plaguing him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth gathered the child in her arms,
and his howls changed to sobs. Rob
stood petrified with amazement at her
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; said Diogenes
between gulps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needn&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; promised Beth. &ldquo;Stay
here with me, and we&rsquo;ll have dinner with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
the boys and then we&rsquo;ll go home and get
some ice cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All yite,&rdquo; agreed the appeased Polydore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May Lucien and I stay to dinner,
too?&rdquo; asked Rob humbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Beth,&rdquo; I remonstrated. &ldquo;Silvia
will be worrying about Di. How can we
explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silvia has gone to Windy Creek for the
day. You see, I met that woman you
sent to the hotel, and she told me she saw
Di going over the hill with a boy, and I
suddenly seemed to smell one of your
mice, so I sent the woman on her way,
and told Silvia you and Rob had found
Diogenes. Just then some people she
knew came along in a car and asked her
to go to Windy Creek. I made her go and
told her I&rsquo;d look after Di.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick, Beth!&rdquo; applauded
Ptolemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you boys will be very careful and not
let anyone besides us know you are here,
so mudder will not hear of it, for though
she&rsquo;d like to see you&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;this without a
flicker or flinch&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;we want her to have a
nice rest. I&rsquo;ll come over every day except
tomorrow and bring things from the hotel
store, and bake up cookies and cake for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A yell of approval went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you come tomorrow?&rdquo;
asked the greedy Demetrius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve promised to go to the
other end of the lake on a picnic. All
the people at the hotel are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come tomorrow and spend the
whole day with you,&rdquo; promised Rob.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a ride in the sailboat and do
all sorts of things.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, aren&rsquo;t you going on that infernal
picnic?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll have all the picnic I want
over here. Like Ptolemy I feel that I
want to play with some of my own kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth looked at him approvingly; then
she said a little sarcastically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll change your mind&ndash;&ndash;about
going on the picnic, I mean&ndash;&ndash;when
you see the new girl who just came to the
hotel on the morning stage. She&rsquo;s a
blonde, and not peroxided, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would certainly drive him down
here, or anywhere,&rdquo; I laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you like blondes?&rdquo; she asked
innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; I began, but
Ptolemy rudely interrupted with an elaborate
description of a new kind of fishing
tackle he had bought.</p>
<p>Then Beth bade Pythagoras build a fire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
in the cook-stove while she set the room to
rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll eat out of doors,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
think it would be more appetizing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; Rob asked
her as we were leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rowed over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come over and row you back?&rdquo;
he asked pleadingly.</p>
<p>She hesitated, and then, realizing that
she could scarcely manage a boat and
Diogenes at the same time, assented, bidding
him not come, however, until five
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have enough of the Polydores
by that time,&rdquo; I said to Rob on our way
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said reflectively,
&ldquo;I like Ptolemy. There&rsquo;s the making of
a man in him, if he has only half a chance.
I didn&rsquo;t suppose your sister understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
children so well or was so fond of them.
She looked quite the little housewife, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d discover a lot of things you
don&rsquo;t know, if you&rsquo;d cultivate the society
of women,&rdquo; I informed him.</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter XI</span></h2>
<h3><i>A Bad Means to a Good End</i></h3>
</div>
<p>When we were setting out on the
proposed picnic the next day,
Rob made himself extremely unpopular
by announcing his intention to spend
the day otherwise. The new blonde girl
gave him fetching glances of entreaty which
he never even saw. He made another sensation
by proposing to keep Diogenes with
him. To Silvia&rsquo;s surprise, Diogenes voiced
his delight and chattered away, I suppose,
about playing with the boys, but fortunately
no one understood him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you change your mind and
come, too?&rdquo; he asked Beth.</p>
<p>She seemed on the point of accepting
and then firmly declined.</p>
<p>When we returned at six o&rsquo;clock, Rob
and Diogenes were awaiting us. There
was something in Rob&rsquo;s eyes I had not seen
there before. He had the look of one in
love with life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have a nice time playing solitaire?&rdquo;
asked Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a very nice time,&rdquo; he replied
with a subtle smile, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t play
solitaire. You know I had Diogenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diogenes apparently had a good time,
too,&rdquo; said Silvia, looking at the child, who
was certainly a wreck in the way of garments.
&ldquo;What did you do all day, Rob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went out on the water, played
games, and had a picnic dinner outdoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had huckleberry pie for one thing,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
she observed, with a glance at Diogenes&rsquo;
dress, &ldquo;and jelly for another, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicken, baked potatoes, milk, cake,
and ice cream,&rdquo; he finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get ice cream?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went down to a dairy farm and got
a gallon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gallon!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;For you
and Diogenes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t eat it all,&rdquo; he said guardedly.
&ldquo;I gave what we didn&rsquo;t eat to some stray
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Di won&rsquo;t be ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; asserted Rob. &ldquo;I am sure
he is made of cast iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout dinner Rob remained in high
spirits. He kept eyeing Beth in a way
that disconcerted her, and then suddenly
he would smile with the expression of one
who knows something funny, but intends
to keep it a secret.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>Presently Silvia left us and went upstairs
to give Diogenes a bath before she
put him to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had two days&rsquo; freedom from
the last of the Polydores,&rdquo; I called after
her. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem delightful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien,&rdquo; she answered slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
really missed the care of him. I was lonesome
for him all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t such a bad little kid when he is
out from Polydore environment,&rdquo; I admitted,
regretting that he had been restored
to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell us all about your day with the
boys,&rdquo; Beth asked Rob, when we were
left alone. &ldquo;It really does seem too bad
to keep a secret from Silvia, and yet it
is a case of where ignorance is bliss&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be folly to be otherwise,&rdquo;
finished Rob. &ldquo;Well, Diogenes and I left
here with a boat load of supplies in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
way of provender and things for the boys.
I had to tie Diogenes in the boat, of course,
so he would not try some aquatic feat. He
objected and yelled like a fiend all the
way. I was glad there was no one at the
hotel to come out and arrest me for cruelty
to children. Of course before we landed,
his cries were heard by his brothers and
they were all at the water&rsquo;s edge. They
made mulepacks of themselves and transferred
the commissary supplies. The ice
cream and bats and balls which I found at
the store made quite a hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We played baseball, fished, and had a
spread on the shore. Then Ptolemy and
I rowed out to where the sailboat was. I
explained the mysteries of the jib and he
caught on instantly. We took in the other
Polydores and sailed for a couple of hours.
Then we all went in swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Diogenes!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I tucked him under my
arm and he seemed perfectly at home, although
greatly disappointed because we
didn&rsquo;t succeed in catching a snake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I finally landed them all safely under
the roof of the Haunted House, and
Ptolemy assured me it was the best day of
his young life. In appreciation of the
diversions I had afforded him, he made a
confession which proved such good news
to me that I was a lenient listener and
exacted no penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me that on the day of Miss
Wade&rsquo;s and my arrival at your house, he
had made a misstatement to each of us
and had not repeated to us accurately what
he had overheard you telling Silvia when
he was on the porch roof. Miss Wade,
what did he tell you about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that Lucien said that your only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
failing was that you were daffy over women
and made love to every one you saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Beth!&rdquo; I cried, light bursting in,
&ldquo;and you believed that little wretch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that is why you have been so&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;so&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; repeated Rob grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never did have any use for a
man-flirt, and I was awfully disappointed,
for I had thought from what Rob said
that you were a man&rsquo;s man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, of course, when for the first
time in my life I began being interested in
a woman&ndash;&ndash;in you&ndash;&ndash;I played right into
that little scamp&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a man&rsquo;s man, Beth,&rdquo; I said
warmly. &ldquo;What Ptolemy heard me say
was that Rob was a woman-hater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not!&rdquo; declared Rob indignantly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;just
a woman-shyer, but I haven&rsquo;t
finished with Ptolemy&rsquo;s confession. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
wonder, now, if either of you can guess
what he told me was Miss Wade&rsquo;s characteristic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare guess,&rdquo; laughed Beth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I did say about Beth was that
she was a born flirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not!&rdquo; protested my sister, in resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should prefer that appellation to the
one he gave you. He said you were
strong-minded and a man-hater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Beth saw the irony of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him,&rdquo; continued Rob, &ldquo;what
his motive was, and he said &lsquo;Stepdaddy
didn&rsquo;t want Beth to know about the man-hater
business,&rsquo; so he took that means of
throwing you off the track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the occasion to talk to him like
a Dutch uncle, though I don&rsquo;t know
exactly what that is. I think it was the
first time anything but brute force had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
been tried on him. I must have touched
some little flicker of the right thing in
him, for he was really contrite and seemed
to sense a different angle of vision when I
explained to him what havoc could be
worked by the misinformation of meddlers.
He promised me he&rsquo;d try to overcome his
tendency to start things going wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made no comment, but it occurred to
me that Ptolemy was a shrewd little fellow,
and that there had been wisdom back of
his strategic speeches to Beth and Rob,
for he had taken the one sure course to
make them both &ldquo;take notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Beth,&rdquo; said Rob, and her name
seemed to come quite handily to him,
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t we cut out the past ten days and
begin our acquaintance right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had better go upstairs,&rdquo; I suggested,
&ldquo;and tell Silvia that Diogenes doesn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
need a bath, seeing he has been in swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of them urged me to remain, so
I went up to our room and found Silvia
tucking Diogenes under cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you come up for?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;I was just coming down to join you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth is treating Rob so&ndash;&ndash;differently,
that I thought it well to retreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad! Whatever came over
the spirit of her dreams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve just discovered in the course
of conversation that Ptolemy as usual
crossed the wires and told Beth Rob was
a flirt, and then informed Rob that Beth
was strong-minded and a man-hater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the little imp!&rdquo; she exclaimed indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It worked, anyway, so
Ptolemy was the bad means to a good
end.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How did they ever happen to discover
what he had done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They caught on from something Rob
said,&rdquo; I told her, feeling again guilty at
keeping my first secret from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a fine match for Beth,&rdquo; said
Silvia. &ldquo;Rob is such a splendid man,
and then he has plenty of money. He
can give her anything she wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I winced. I think Silvia must have
been conscious of it, even though the room
was dark, for she came to me quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could give you&ndash;&ndash;everything&ndash;&ndash;anything&ndash;&ndash;you
want, Silvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have, Lucien. The things that
no money could buy&ndash;&ndash;love and protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, maybe I had. I had surely given
her protection from the Polydores, though
she didn&rsquo;t know to what extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to give you more material
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
things, though, Silvia. When we go home,
I shall start to work in earnest and see if
I can&rsquo;t get enough ahead to make a good
investment I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather do without the necessities
even, Lucien, than to have you work any
harder than you have been doing. We
must let well enough alone.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>&ldquo;<i>Too Much Polydores</i>&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>The next morning at breakfast, Beth
announced that she and Rob were
going to spend the day camping in
the woods.</p>
<p>Silvia and I tried not to look significantly
at each other, but Beth was very keen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take Diogenes with us,&rdquo; she
instantly added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; protested Silvia. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be
such a bother. And then he can&rsquo;t walk
very far, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be no bother,&rdquo; persisted Beth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll borrow the little cart to draw
him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; acquiesced Rob. &ldquo;We sure
want Diogenes with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have them put up a lunch for you,&rdquo;
proposed Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rob objected. &ldquo;We are going to
forage and cook over a fire in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I proposed to Silvia with alacrity,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have our first day alone together&ndash;&ndash;the
first we have had since the
Polydores came into our lives. I&rsquo;ll rent the
&lsquo;autoo&rsquo; again, and we will go through the
country and dine at some little wayside inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the &lsquo;autoo&rsquo;, now, Lucien,&rdquo; advised
Beth privately, &ldquo;and make an early start,
so Rob and I can take supplies from the
store without arousing Silvia&rsquo;s suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; said Silvia disappointedly,
when we were &ldquo;autooing&rdquo; on
our way, &ldquo;that they are in love after all,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
or that he has proposed, or that he is going
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you draw all those pessimistic
inferences from?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From their both being so keen to take
Diogenes with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diogenes would be no barrier to their
love-making,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t
repeat what they said; at least, not so
anyone could understand him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many miles away we came upon a picturesque
little old-time tavern where we
had an appetizing dinner, and then continued
on our aimless way. It was nearly
ten o&rsquo;clock when we returned to the hotel,
where the owner of the &ldquo;autoo&rdquo; was waiting.</p>
<p>Rob came down the roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Beth?&rdquo; asked Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has gone to bed. The day in the
open made her sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Silvia had left us, the old farmer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
said with a chuckle: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t offer you another
swig of stone fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably just as well you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be introduced to one,&rdquo; said
Rob, who appeared to be somewhat downcast.
&ldquo;I sure need a bracer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Rob?&rdquo; I asked
when we were lighting our pipes. &ldquo;A
strenuous day? Two in rapid &lsquo;concussion&rsquo;
with the Polydores must be nerve-racking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I admit there seemed to be &lsquo;too
much Polydores.&rsquo; We all had a happy reunion,
and I devoted the forenoon to the
entertainment of the famous family so I
could be entitled to the afternoon off to
spend with Beth. At noon we built a fire
and cooked a sumptuous dinner. Beth
baked up some things to keep them supplied
a couple of days longer. After dinner
I asked her to go for a row. She insisted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
on taking Diogenes along, and the
others all followed us on a raft. So I
decided to cut the water sports short, and
Beth and I started for a walk in the woods.
Three or more were constantly right on
our trail. I begged and bribed, but to
no avail. They were sticktights all right,
and,&rdquo; he added morosely, &ldquo;she seemed
covertly to aid and abet them. When we
started for home, I found that the young
fiends had broken the cart, so I had to
carry Diogenes most of the way, and of
course he bellowed as usual at being parted
from the whelps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_28' id='linki_28'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-033.jpg' alt='' title='' width='177' height='289' /><br />
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t such &lsquo;fine little chaps&rsquo;
after all,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t resist commenting.
&ldquo;Familiarity breeds contempt, you see. I
am sorry Diogenes had so much of their
society. He&rsquo;ll be unendurable tomorrow.
Well, you had some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did the Polydores. Demetrius and
Diogenes fell in the fire twice. Emerald
threw a finger out of joint, but Ptolemy
quickly jerked it into place. Pythagoras
was kicked off the raft twice, following a
mutiny. Demetrius threw a lighted match
into the vines and set fire to the house.
They said it was a &lsquo;beaut of a day&rsquo;, though,
and urged us to come tomorrow and repeat
the program. By the way, they went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
across the lake on their raft yesterday and
bought a tent of some campers. They have
pitched it in the woods beyond the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I went upstairs Silvia met me
disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t propose,&rdquo; she said disappointedly.
&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t let him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you wake her up to find out?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hadn&rsquo;t gone to bed and she wasn&rsquo;t
sleepy. She was trimming a hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t she let him propose, if
she cares for him?&rdquo; I asked perplexedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; explained Silvia, &ldquo;that
when a girl&ndash;&ndash;a coquette girl like Beth&ndash;&ndash;is
as sure of a man as she is of Rob, she
gets a touch of contrariness or offishness
or something. She said it would have been
too prosaic and cut and dried if they had
gone away for a day in the woods and come
back engaged. She wants the unexpected.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she loves him?&rdquo; I asked
interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t say so. You can&rsquo;t tell
from what she says anyway. Still, I think
she is hovering around the danger point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d better watch out. Rob isn&rsquo;t
the kind of a man who will stand for too
much thwarting,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;d only play up a little bit to some
one else, it would bring things to a climax,&rdquo;
said my wife sagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one else to play up to. The
blonde left today because it was so slow
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some new girl will come tomorrow,&rdquo;
said Silvia, &ldquo;or there&rsquo;s that
trim little waitress who is waiting her way
through college. He gave her a good big tip
yesterday. I think I will give him a hint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t help any. He wouldn&rsquo;t
know how to play such a game if you could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
persuade him to try. He&rsquo;d probably tell
the girl his motive in being attentive to her
and then she&rsquo;d back out. Maybe, after
all, Beth doesn&rsquo;t love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she does,&rdquo; replied my wife,
&ldquo;because she is getting absent-minded.
She let Diogenes go too near the fire. His
shoes are burned, his hair singed, and his
dress scorched. He woke up when I came
in and he was so cross. He acted just
the way he does when he is with his
brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter XIII</span></h2>
<h3><i>Rob&rsquo;s Friend the Reporter</i></h3>
</div>
<p>Silvia&rsquo;s vague prophecy was fulfilled.
When the event of the day,
the arrival of the stage, occurred, a
solitary passenger alighted, a slim, alert,
city-cut young woman.</p>
<p>She looked us all over&ndash;&ndash;not boldly, but
with a business-like directness as if she
were taking inventory of stock, or acting
as judge at a competition. When her
blue eyes lighted on Rob, they darkened
with pleasure.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Rossiter!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;this is better than I hoped for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands with the air of being
old acquaintances, and he introduced her to
us as &ldquo;Miss Frayne, from my home town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went into the office, registered, and
sent her bag to her room. Then she asked
Rob if she might have a talk with him.</p>
<p>They walked away together down to
the shore and she was talking to him quite
excitedly. Rob suddenly stopped, threw
back his head and laughed in the way
that it is good to hear a man laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Frayne must be a wit,&rdquo; observed
Beth dryly.</p>
<p>I looked at her keenly. Something in
her eyes as she gazed after the retreating
couple told me that Silvia&rsquo;s surmise was
right, and that Miss Frayne might be just
the little punch needed to send Beth over
the danger point.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I rather incline to the belief that
Ptolemy told the truth in the first place,&rdquo;
she continued, and then looked disappointed
because I did not contradict her.</p>
<p>I decided not to reveal, for the present
anyway, what I knew of Miss Frayne, of
whom I had often heard Rob speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be going to stay long,&rdquo; said Silvia
hopefully. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t bring a trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t need one,&rdquo; replied Beth.
&ldquo;She is probably one of those mannish
girls who believe in a skirt and a few
waists for a wardrobe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Rob and the newcomer returned,
he seemed to be monopolizing the conversation
in a very emphatic and earnest
manner. As they came up the steps to the
veranda, we heard her say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Rossiter, I will do just
as you say. I have perfect confidence in
your judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>They passed on into the hotel and
Beth jumped up and went down toward
the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear Rob speak of this
Miss Frayne?&rdquo; asked Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often. She is engaged to his cousin,
and is a reporter on a big newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so? Oh, Lucien,&rdquo;
she continued before I could speak, &ldquo;were
you really shrewd enough to see which way
the wind was blowing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. After you set my sails for me
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Rob came out of the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Lucien, I want to see you a minute.
Come on down the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got some work ahead,&rdquo; he said
when we were out of Silvia&rsquo;s hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Frayne is up&ndash;&ndash;and doing. What
do you suppose her paper sent her here for?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;For a rest, or to write up the mosquitoes
of H. H.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H. H. is all right, only it happens they
stand for Haunted House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, really. The rumors of the house
and the ghost, greatly elaborated, of course,
reached the Sunday editor of the paper
Miss Frayne is on, and he sent her up here
to revive the story of the murder, translate
the ghost, and get snapshots of the house.
She was quite keen to have me take her
there at once, so she could commence her
article, but I headed her off, so she wouldn&rsquo;t
discover the summer boarders at the hotel
annex. I assured her that daytime was
not the time to gather material and the
only way she could get a proper focus on
the ghost and acquire the thrills necessary
for an inspiration was to see the place
first by night.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If she would view Fair Melrose aright,&rdquo;
I quoted, &ldquo;she must visit it in the pale
moonlight, but you were very clever to
delay her visit long enough for us to get
over there and warn the enemy. If she
had gone down there and caught the
Polydores unawares, she would have come
back here and revealed our secret, and
there would be the end of Silvia&rsquo;s vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth, Lucien, I wasn&rsquo;t
thinking so much of that as I was of Miss
Frayne&rsquo;s interests. You see she has come
a long ways for a story and if it collapsed
from her ghostly expectations to a showdown
of four healthy boys, the blow might
mean a good deal to her in a business way.
I think we had better let Ptolemy plant a
ghost just once more for her. You know
you made him take a reef in the flapping of
ghostly garments. Can&rsquo;t we resurrect the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
specter and restore the wails just for tonight,
and bring her over here at the
witching hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we will,&rdquo; I agreed heartily. &ldquo;She
shall have her ghost and all the trappings.
It will give the Polydores the time of their
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over there now and put Ptolemy
next so he can get busy on his spirits.&rdquo;
We went down to the shore and pulled
off. Midway across the lake, Rob suddenly
rested on his oars and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did Beth go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to first principles,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;She thinks, judging from your excited,
earnest manner in addressing Miss Frayne
and your rushing frantically away for a
walk with her before she had removed the
travel dust, that Ptolemy was quite correct,
after all, in declaring you to be a
&lsquo;ladies&rsquo; man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you explain to her who Miss
Frayne was?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I am on my vacation
and I am not doing any explaining, professionally
or otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung the boat around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starboard!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know a trump card when you see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he rested on his oars and stared
at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Lucien? If you
have a grain of hope for me, please let me
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I repeated Silvia&rsquo;s theories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to win her that way,&rdquo;
he said slowly, &ldquo;not by playing a part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I declared, &ldquo;if you go back to
the hotel now, you can&rsquo;t explain Miss
Frayne to Beth, because she went for a
walk with old Professor Treadtop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned the boat again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Silvia won&rsquo;t come to the Haunted
House, will she?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. Nothing would induce
her to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you bring Miss Frayne here tonight
and I&rsquo;ll bring Beth. And I&rsquo;ll be sure
that there are no double boats lying around
loose. I&rsquo;ll have two at the dock, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your system,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I
am not sure how I can explain Miss Frayne
to Silvia. Silvia is not in the least narrow-minded,
but still to leave the hotel at
midnight with a perfectly strange young
woman&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell her I want a clear field for
Beth. She will see it is in a good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Polydores greeted us rapturously
and roughly. When I had restored order,
and they were once more right side up, I
addressed the chief of the bandits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptolemy,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;a young lady,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
who is a reporter for a big newspaper, has
come from many miles away to write up
the haunted house and the ghost, and they
will be pictured out in the Sunday edition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ptolemy&rsquo;s eyes glistened, and &ldquo;Them
Three&rdquo; were instantly &ldquo;at attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, say, stepdaddy,&rdquo; begged the young
chief, &ldquo;let me play ghost right for her, just
once, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may for tonight,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but
you will have to be very careful and not
overdo the matter, for she isn&rsquo;t the kind
that is easily fooled. She&rsquo;s had to keep
her eyes and wits sharpened, else she
wouldn&rsquo;t be on a newspaper, so I want
you to be very careful and not bungle.
Make a neat job of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it up brown, you bet!&rdquo; he cried
gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw, do it up white,&rdquo; drawled Pythagoras.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Show me your ghost stuff by daylight,&rdquo;
I demanded, &ldquo;and let me see how you are
going to rig him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought forth a head and shoulders
and arms that were ghastly even in sunlight,
and proceeded to explain them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got this skull out of father&rsquo;s study,
and the arms came off a skeleton mother
had in her antiquities. I dressed them
up in a pillow case and the white cotton
gloves are Huldah&rsquo;s. I can get some
phosphorus in the woods and put it in the
eyes. And Demetrius bought two electric
flashlights yesterday, and Pythagoras
can snap them once in a while from the
lower windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are some little property man,&rdquo;
said Rob in admiration. &ldquo;But tell me
who produces those heart-rending
shrieks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Pythagoras who did the high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
ones. And Em came in with low groans.
Show &rsquo;em, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pythagoras uttered high-trebled, thin-toned
whines and ever and anon Emerald
added a <i>basso profundo</i> accompaniment,
making a combination that was most trying
to the ears at close range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;as I want
Beth subjected to such a realistic performance.
We will loiter in the distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your rehearsal,&rdquo; I assured Ptolemy,
&ldquo;is very good, but you must remember
that Miss Frayne is used to encountering
things far more terrible than ghosts. She
may insist on coming right in here to investigate.
Of course, if she does, I can&rsquo;t
refuse or she&rsquo;ll think I am afraid, or else
that I put up a fake ghost here, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lock the door with a chair,&rdquo; suggested
Emerald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be quite capable of breaking into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
a little house like this, but I&rsquo;ll keep her
back until you have time to haul in your
ghost and make a quick and quiet getaway
by a back window. Then another thing,
she&rsquo;ll be over here tomorrow morning to
take some pictures of the house, so by sunrise
I want you all to take up your abode
in the tent you have in the woods and
stay there until I come and tell you the
coast is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dead on,&rdquo; assured Ptolemy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s going to be something
doing. We&rsquo;re getting tired of being here
alone. I had to tie Demetrius up this
morning. He was bound to go over to
the hotel and see mudder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t one of you dare to make such an
attempt,&rdquo; I said peremptorily. &ldquo;You keep
right on here for a few days. Some of us,
either Rob, or Beth and I will drop over
every day. If you play your ghost just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
as I tell you and keep out of sight, I&rsquo;ll
bring you over some ice cream tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a bigger bat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a mitt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a boat,&rdquo; came in chorus from
Ptolemy, Emerald, and Demetrius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you give me to stay here?&rdquo;
asked Pythagoras, who was a born bargain-driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a licking if you don&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo;
was the only offer he gleaned from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be good boys,&rdquo; adjured the softhearted
Rob, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll bring you everything
I can find at the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was long past the luncheon hour
when we returned. We found Miss Frayne
wondering at Rob&rsquo;s sudden disappearance
and Beth was accordingly mystified.</p>
<p>I planted myself directly in front of
Miss Frayne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I take you to the haunted house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
tonight at the yawning churchyard hour?&rdquo;
I asked. &ldquo;I am most eminently fitted to
be your guide, for I was the first one of
this assembly to see the ghost <i>in toto</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw it over a stone fence,&rdquo; remarked
Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you may, thank you very
much,&rdquo; she said enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Silvia&rsquo;s face was a study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you come with me, Beth?&rdquo;
asked Rob. &ldquo;Of course, the ghost is an
old story to us, but we really should hover
in Lucien&rsquo;s wake out of regard to the
conventions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Frayne interested in ghosts?&rdquo;
asked Beth.</p>
<p>Miss Frayne turned and answered the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not personally,&rdquo; she admitted frankly,
&ldquo;but the newspaper I am on is, and they
sent me up here to get a story.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are a reporter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; on the <i>Times</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be one long, though,&rdquo; asserted
Rob cheerfully, &ldquo;because she is
going to marry my cousin in the fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth&rsquo;s expression remained neutral at
the announcement, but I noticed throughout
the afternoon that she was extremely
affable toward Miss Frayne, and that she
had the whiphand again with Rob, and
meanwhile he seemed to be gathering a
grim determination to do or die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien, how did you come to ask Miss
Frayne to go to that awful place tonight?&rdquo;
asked Silvia when we had gone to our room
for a siesta, which seemed impossible by
reason of the bellowing of Diogenes, who
balked at being required to lie down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob asked me to,&rdquo; I informed her,
when I had cowed Diogenes, &ldquo;so he could
have a free field for Beth. I believe he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
planned this expedition so he could storm
the citadel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe he is wise. Girls like
Beth have to be taken by storm sometimes.
I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Rob could
be a bit of a bully, too, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ended her speculations in a shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lucien! Diogenes has jumped out
the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We rushed down stairs, Silvia informing
the guests in transit of the awful catastrophe.</p>
<p>Silvia paused at the door opening on to
the veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; she said faintly,
closing her eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tend to
it alone, Lucien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth was already at the telephone,
which connected with the country doctor&rsquo;s.
Rob joined me. We located our window,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
and began hunting underneath for the
pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world do you suppose he
landed?&rdquo; asked Rob.</p>
<p>Just then the missing one came around
the house clasping a bologna sausage in
his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye Gods and little Polydores!&rdquo; exclaimed
Rob.</p>
<p>I caught Diogenes by the arm and
rushed him in to Silvia.</p>
<p>I found her in company with an old
colored mammy, who was laundress for
the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho&rsquo;,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;I done gwine
by de windah with ma baby cab full o&rsquo;
cloes, an&rsquo; dis yer white chile done come
tumblin&rsquo; down an&rsquo; fall right in ma cab.
Now, what do you think o&rsquo; dat? I reckon
I was nevah so done clean skeert afoah
in ma life. An&rsquo; ef de chile didn&rsquo;t grab one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
of ma bolognas and done git out de cab
an&rsquo; run around de house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Silvia, &ldquo;poor little baby!
Come to mudder. Lucien, where are you
going with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had picked up the acrobatic Polydore
and was going up the stairs two at a
time. I gained our room, locked the
door and proceeded to give the &ldquo;poor
little baby&rdquo; all that was coming to him.
Now and then above his howls, I heard
Silvia&rsquo;s plaintive protests outside the door,
but I finished my job completely and
satisfactorily, and laid the penitent Polydore
in his little bed. Then I went out into
the hall, feeling better than I had in months.</p>
<p>Silvia essayed to pass me, but I took
her arm and led her to a recess in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am convinced,&rdquo; I told her, &ldquo;that we
have Diogenes as a permanent pensioner
on our hands, so it was up to me to show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
him where to get off. You can&rsquo;t go to him
for a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went down stairs and I was sure I
read suppressed regret in the faces of most
of the guests at learning of the soft place
in which Diogenes&rsquo; lot had been cast.
Silvia tearfully told Rob and Beth of my
cruelty.</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do him good!&rdquo; approved Rob heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How mean men are!&rdquo; declared Beth
indignantly. &ldquo;I am going up and comfort
the poor little thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I held up the key to the room with a
grin, and she had to content herself by
making unkind remarks about me.</p>
<p>At the expiration of the allotted time, I
handed Silvia the key. She took it from
me without a word or a look. It was
quite evident I was in wrong.</p>
<p>In half an hour my wife came down,
carrying Diogenes, who, dressed in fresh
white clothes, was a good picture of an
angel child. She passed me and went to
a remote corner of the veranda and sat
down. When he spied me, he leaped from
her arms and ran to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ocean,&rdquo; he said propitiatingly, &ldquo;me
love oo.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>I took him up. His arms clasped about
my neck, and over his curly head, I winked
at Silvia and Beth.</p>
<p>Rob roared.</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter XIV</span></h2>
<h3><i>A Midnight Excursion</i></h3>
</div>
<p>The night was Satan&rsquo;s own: dark,
wind-shrieking, and Polydorish.
No one saw us leave the hotel when,
at a late hour, we started on our little
excursion. On account of the darkness
and the poor landing near the haunted
house, we decided to go by the overland
route. I managed to purloin a lantern
from the kitchen to light our path.</p>
<p>Rob and Beth kept behind Miss Frayne
and myself, and in spite of the wildness of
the weather, he was evidently pleading his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
suit, for now and then above the roar of
the wind, I heard his ardent voice. Apparently
Beth had not yet given him any
encouragement.</p>
<p>Going down the lane my lantern underwent
a total eclipse, so we had a Jordan-like
road to travel. Miss Frayne was
quite impervious to unfavorable conditions,
as it was a matter of bread and butter to
her, she said, and she was accustomed to
braving worse storms than this, and anyway
she hadn&rsquo;t come here for a summer picnic.</p>
<p>When we came into the grove it was so
dark, I lost my bearings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we bring a flashlight?&rdquo;
asked Beth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were none at the hotel,&rdquo; I told
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know some boys,&rdquo; said Rob with a
little laugh, &ldquo;who would have lent us one&ndash;&ndash;maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>Fortunately we were well provided with
safety matches and after striking a box or
so, we gained the open. A rise of ground
hid the house, but when we climbed to the
top, the ghost loomed up ghastlier than
ever.</p>
<p>I felt the business-like Miss Frayne start
and shiver as a little scream escaped her.
I didn&rsquo;t wonder. Even I, knowing that it
was an illusion and a snare, felt my flesh
creeping as I looked at the ghastly thing in
the window.</p>
<p>Every now and then according to schedule
a light flashed from the windows below.
And then came the blood-curdling sounds&ndash;&ndash;whimpers
and groans that were rivaling
the whistling of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful!&rdquo; said Miss Frayne in a
hoarse whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go inside the house?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;o! I couldn&rsquo;t. Not tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were some little in advance of Rob
and Beth. When one spectral sound came
like a tense whisper, Miss Frayne turned
and fled, and of course I followed her. We
could not see our two companions, but
suddenly in an interim of wind and ghost
whispers, we heard Beth say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Rob. I think we should really
be cosier in a story-and-a-half cottage than
we should in a bungalow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye Gods!&rdquo; muttered Miss Frayne, &ldquo;did
he propose in the face of that awful Thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship ahoy!&rdquo; I called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t you go inside?&rdquo; asked Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in! I wouldn&rsquo;t go inside that place;
not if I lose my job on the paper. What
can it be? You don&rsquo;t seem to mind it,
Miss Wade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; said Beth apologetically,
&ldquo;this is my third performance.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>We were now down the hill out of sight
of the gruesome, ghastly window display,
and Miss Frayne gained courage as we
retreated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but what do you suppose that
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a theory,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that it is the
work of a lunatic, but I&rsquo;ve since concluded
it is due to practical jokers. I&rsquo;ll tell you
what I&rsquo;ll do. If you wait here, I&rsquo;ll investigate
and see what I can find out for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, would you really dare, Mr. Wade?
I don&rsquo;t believe men ever have creepy
nerves,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>I began to feel ashamed of my deception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go, Lucien,&rdquo; warned Rob,
coming to my rescue. &ldquo;There may be a
gang of desperadoes in there, or counterfeit
money-makers, or something of that kind.
Besides, I have a far more interesting piece
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
of news than anything the ghost could
give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob!&rdquo; protested Beth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know it already,&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
to be a story-and-a-half high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I am getting material for quite
a story,&rdquo; declared Miss Frayne.</p>
<p>I knew Beth&rsquo;s dislike of scenes and display
of emotions&ndash;&ndash;mock heroics&ndash;&ndash;she
called them, so I made no congratulatory
speeches of the bless-you-my-children order,
but presently under the cover of darkness,
I felt a little hand slipped in mine, and my
clasp was eloquent of what I felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Miss Frayne, &ldquo;that daylight
will make me so ashamed of my
cowardice that I can come down here and
take some pictures and go inside the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all come with you,&rdquo; promised
Beth. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s safety in numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>When we were back at the hotel I managed
to have a few words with Rob before
we went upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless the ghost!&rdquo; he said cheerily.
&ldquo;When Beth first glimpsed it, she just
turned and fell into my arms. She was
really frightened for the first time. I shall
feel under obligations to Ptolemy for a
lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; I ejaculated fervently,
&ldquo;that I am under no obligations to
a Polydore. Ptolemy certainly did put
up the most ghastly thing in the way of
ghosts. The lights in the eyes of the
skeleton were frightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the ghost?&rdquo; asked Silvia
sleepily, when I came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; same old ghost, only more of
him,&rdquo; I assured her.</p>
<p>She was asleep before I had uttered this
reply.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Silvia,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have a more startling
piece of news for you than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat bolt upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they engaged, Lucien?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are. They are building their
castle&ndash;&ndash;I mean their story-and-a-half
cottage already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas for my own desire to sleep! I had
so effectually awakened Silvia that she
planned Beth&rsquo;s trousseau, the wedding,
honeymoon, and the furnishing of their
house before she subsided.</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter XV</span></h2>
<h3><i>What Miss Frayne Found Out</i></h3>
</div>
<p>We had planned to go to the haunted
house at nine o&rsquo;clock the next
morning, but owing to my dissipation
of the night before, it was long
after the appointed hour when Silvia awoke
me.</p>
<p>I hurried down stairs and ate my breakfast
in solitude. I inquired for Beth and
Rob, but the waitress told me they had left
the dining-room at seven o&rsquo;clock and gone
for a walk in the woods. She said it with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
a knowing smile that told me she, too, must
be a &ldquo;sister of the Golden Circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Miss Frayne?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went down the road over an hour
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently her courage had come up with
the sun. I was greatly disturbed at the
chance of her stumbling over one or more
Polydores, and Rob didn&rsquo;t want to let the
cat out of the bag until her article was
written, as he believed that if the ghostly
spell were broken, she would lose her
&ldquo;punch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was unable to think of any plausible
explanation to offer Silvia as to why I
should start in pursuit, and I wished all
sorts of dire calamities on Rob&rsquo;s blond
head. Lovers were surely blind and selfish.</p>
<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock they came strolling
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know it was so late,&rdquo; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Beth cheerfully, &ldquo;but the boys will keep
in the woods all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With her nose for news, there is no
telling how far into the woods Miss Frayne&rsquo;s
investigation will take her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say we go down by the lane and meet
her,&rdquo; proposed Beth, &ldquo;so that if she has
run across the boys we can explain to her
why we desire secrecy from Silvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Rob go,&rdquo; I advised. &ldquo;It
would seem odd to Silvia if we didn&rsquo;t ask
her to go with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the newly engaged couple started
down the road, but in their self-absorption
they didn&rsquo;t notice the turn to the lane, and
they got half way to Windy Creek before
they came back to earth and the hotel.
Miss Frayne still had not shown up, and I
began to have misgivings lest the Polydores
had locked her up in the house, but
finally just as we were having a happy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
family gathering and discussing the new
event under the shade of the one resort
tree, she came excitedly up to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such an interesting morning as I have
had!&rdquo; she exclaimed enthusiastically. &ldquo;I
made some corking pictures of the place,
and I&rsquo;ve found out about not only that
ghost, but all ghosts&ndash;&ndash;the whole race of
ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hurriedly interrupted her and made
elaborate and jumbled apologies for not
keeping our engagement, which evidently
bored her and mystified Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad I went alone,&rdquo; she finally
replied. &ldquo;Otherwise I might not have
got such an interesting interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth, Rob, and I made frantic and appealing
gestures to her behind Silvia&rsquo;s
back, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to notice them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom did you interview, the ghost?&rdquo;
asked Silvia.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. Some very interesting and
unusual people who are staying there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I threw her a wildly beseeching glance
and Beth and Rob began at the same time
to ply her with distracting questions. I
think she seemed to divine that there was
something in the situation that was not
to be explained, but Silvia interrupted
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let Miss Frayne tell us about her
interview,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We all seem to be
very talkative today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw there was no way to dodge the
d&eacute;nouement, so I awaited the finale in
dread desperation. It proved to be more
of a stunner than I had expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went down the lane,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
through the grove, up the little hill, and
laughed at myself for the hallucinations
of the night before. There were no ghosts
visible and the door to the haunted house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
was hospitably open. I stood on the hill
long enough to make some pictures and
then went on. I walked up the steps
fearlessly and looked within. A woman,
an untidy, disheveled-looking woman, sat
at a table writing furiously in just the same
breathless way I write when I have a scoop,
and the presses are waiting open-mouthed
for my copy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looked up and scowled at my intrusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me,&rsquo; she said, and continued
writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went through the house and came
outside again where I met an absent-minded,
spectacled man. I told him who
I was and of my object in coming to the
house. Then he showed signs of coming to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, the ghost!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;That is
what brought me here. My wife is interested
in more tangible, more material
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
things. We have just returned from a long
journey, and when we were nearly to our
destination, our place of residence, I happened
to read in a paper about this haunted
house and its apparition, so we came right
up here this morning to remain overnight
and see if the article were true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him how successful I had been
and he became quite alert and enthusiastic.
He showed me why I should not have been
alarmed, because ghosts, he said, were
scientific facts. He then explained to me
at length how the gases from the dead
arise and form a nebulous vapor or a vaporous
nebula. It sounded very simple and
plausible when he told me, but I can&rsquo;t seem
to remember it. Fortunately I have it all
down in writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia&rsquo;s eyes and mine had met in speechless
horror since she had mentioned the
&ldquo;writing woman.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien!&rdquo; Silvia now said in a tragic,
hoarse whisper&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the Polydores!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you know them?&rdquo; asked Miss
Frayne. &ldquo;Dr. Felix Polydore, the eminent
LL.D. or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole family are D&rsquo;s,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wife is the highest of high-brows,
and they are averse to interviews. They
moved to a small city sometime ago to be
secluded. Just think of my opportunity!
I have them headlined! &lsquo;The Haunted
House of Hope Haven. Ghost that appears
at midnight scientifically explained
by the distinguished Dr. Felix Polydore.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we are in luck,&rdquo; I said to Silvia,
on second thoughts. &ldquo;We will take them
home by the nape of the neck and deliver
their children into their keeping to have
and to hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t turn Diogenes over to them,&rdquo;
she said plaintively.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Diogenes!&rdquo; repeated Miss Frayne in
astonishment.</p>
<p>I then narrated to her the history of
our next-door neighbors, and how they
planted their five children upon us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better go down at once and see
them,&rdquo; said Silvia, &ldquo;before they escape.
No telling where they might take it in their
heads to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll go soon after
luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrice blessed haunted house,&rdquo; quoted
Rob. &ldquo;It gave me Beth, and it has restored
the parents of the wise Ptolemy and
&lsquo;Them Three.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And gave me a ripping story,&rdquo; said
Miss Frayne.</p>
<p>Just then the gong sounded, and after
luncheon while I was comfortably tipped
back in a chair, my feet on the veranda
rail, seeing in the smoke from my pipe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
dream visions of Polydoreless days, a faint
cry from Silvia brought me back to earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien, look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked.</p>
<p>My chair came down to all fours and my
feet slipped from the rail.</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter XVI</span></h2>
<h3><i>Ptolemy&rsquo;s Tale</i></h3>
</div>
<p>Four defiant, determined-looking
Polydores came up the steps and
bore down upon us. Then Silvia
as usual thought she saw land ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boys,&rdquo; she asked hopefully, &ldquo;did
your father send for you to meet him here?
And when is he going to take you home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you,&rdquo; I thundered at
Ptolemy, &ldquo;that you were not to leave that
house&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It left us,&rdquo; interrupted Emerald with
a grin.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Went up in smoke,&rdquo; added Pythagoras
blithely, &ldquo;ghost and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four minutes quicker,&rdquo; said Demetrius,
&ldquo;and it would have took father and mother,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it the haunted house they are
talking about?&rdquo; asked Miss Frayne joyfully.
&ldquo;What a story I&rsquo;ll have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Life to Miss Frayne seemed to be one
story after another. Well, it was certainly
becoming the same way to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the ghost set fire to the house?&rdquo;
asked Beth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you all talking about,&rdquo; demanded
Silvia, &ldquo;and how did you know
these boys were there? How long have
you been here?&rdquo; she asked, turning to
Ptolemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; I repeated angrily to the
subdued boy, &ldquo;not to leave. Those were
plain orders. If the house did burn up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
you could have stayed in your tent in the
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ptolemy&rsquo;s lips twitched faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house burned up and all our
clothes and our stuff to eat, and our bats
and things, and father and mother went
away and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, so&ndash;&ndash;I
came here. But we&rsquo;ll go back to our
own house. We have learned to cook.
Come on, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay right here with me, son,&rdquo;
and Rob&rsquo;s hand came down intimately
on Ptolemy&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely we&rsquo;ll turn them out into
the woods, when they haven&rsquo;t a roof over
their heads,&rdquo; declared Silvia, drawing
Emerald to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are absolutely inhuman,
Lucien,&rdquo; cried Beth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what has
changed you so,&rdquo; and she proceeded to make
room for Pythagoras in the porch swing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Did the fire scare you?&rdquo; asked Miss
Frayne gently, as she put her arms about
Demetrius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Et tu, Brute? Well, I plainly see
this is no place for an inhuman, childless,
married man,&rdquo; I said with a laugh, walking
down the veranda.</p>
<p>In the doorway I met Diogenes, who
raised his chubby arms invitingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up, up, Ocean!&rdquo; he begged sweetly.</p>
<p>I lifted him to my shoulder, and then
turned and walked triumphantly back to
the family group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;here is the whole
d-dashed family. And I propose that each
keep unto his charge the child he has now
under his wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Frayne quickly relinquished the
dirty Demetrius. Beth shrank away from
Pythagoras.</p>
<p>As I seated myself still holding Diogenes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
his brothers sprang toward him in greeting,
but he spat at one, kicked at another, and
pulled the hair of a third, although he patted
Ptolemy&rsquo;s cheek gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll have this affair thrashed
out,&rdquo; I declared in my most authoritative,
professional manner, and I then proceeded
to explain to Silvia the housing of the Polydores,
and our strategies to keep their
arrival a secret simply on her account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you know,&rdquo; interpolated Beth,
with a consideration for the feelings of the
young Polydores&ndash;&ndash;a consideration they
had never before encountered&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;we
wanted you to have a nice rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia looked quite penitent and remorseful
for her seeming lack of appreciation of
our combined efforts. When I had answered
all her inquiries satisfactorily, Miss Frayne&rsquo;s
curiosity regarding the progeny of the eminent
Polydores had to be fully relieved.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mean that the scribbling
lady I saw at the table is really the mother
of these five boys?&rdquo; she asked, unable to
grasp the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and the father hereof is the man
who explained the ghosts to you so scientifically
that you cannot remember what
he said. Now, Ptolemy, we&rsquo;ll hear your
story of the fire and the whereabouts of
your parents. Take your time and tell
it accurately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see we did just as you said
to, and took the ghost out of the window
and went out to the woods early this
morning so as not to let the paper lady
see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Miss Frayne, &ldquo;am I the
paper lady? I begin to see daylight.
Are these boys the ghost perpetrators, and
were you in on the put-up job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good guesser,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And why wasn&rsquo;t I taken into your
confidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two reasons. First, because
your friend Rob said you&rsquo;d get better
results for copy&ndash;&ndash;more inspirations and
thrills, if you weren&rsquo;t behind the scenes
on the ghost business,&ndash;&ndash;and then we
didn&rsquo;t want to tell you about the presence
of the Polydores lest inadvertently you
betray the fact to my wife. Now, proceed,
Ptolemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After we were in the woods, I heard
an automobile coming down the lane, and
I went up near the edge of the woods and
peeked out behind a tree, and pretty soon
I saw father and mother come over the hill
and go in our haunted house, so I came up
there and hid under the window and heard
mother say: &lsquo;What an ideal place to
write this is. It looks as if I might really
get a chance to write unmo&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ndash;&ndash;lested,&rsquo;&rdquo; I finished for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; he allowed. &ldquo;Well, she
began writing, so I didn&rsquo;t go in, but when
father came outside I went up to him and
told him you and mudder were at the hotel
and that we were all with you. He told
me they came up here to write an article
for some big magazine about the ghost.
He hired an automobile down at Windy
Creek to bring them up to the house and
the man was going to come back for them
tomorrow morning. I didn&rsquo;t let on the
ghost was a fake, because I thought he&rsquo;d
be so disappointed to have all his trouble
for nothing, and he&rsquo;d be mad at me for
swiping his skull. I told him a paper lady
was coming and then I went back to the
woods. He went down with me to see the
boys, and he said he would come back and
have lunch with us. Mother doesn&rsquo;t ever
stop to eat at noon when she is writing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He went back and talked to the paper
lady and pretty soon he came down and
ate with us. I told him all about how we
couldn&rsquo;t get any girl to do the work for us
and so we had been living with you, and
how Di got sick and mudder was all worn
out taking care of him and came down
here to rest, and that you wouldn&rsquo;t cash
the check, so I did and was spending it and
he said that was all right.&rdquo; Here Ptolemy
flashed me a most triumphant glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said you must be paid for all your
expense and trouble, so he made out a
check and gave it to me and told me to
make mudder a nice present. He ain&rsquo;t
so bad when he ain&rsquo;t thinking about dead
stuff. When he felt in his pocket for his
check book, he found a letter he had got
yesterday and forgotten to open, so he
read it then and found it was from some
magazine, and the man said he&rsquo;d pay his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
and mother&rsquo;s expenses to go to Chili and
write up some stuff about&ndash;&ndash;something.
So father said they must go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to Chili!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we all went up to the house with
him and I took mother&rsquo;s pencil and paper
away so she would have to listen. She
was wild for Chili, and I had to go and hunt
up a farmer who had a machine to take
them down to Windy Creek. Father
signed another blank check for you and said
you could board us with it or do anything
you thought best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then mother took a lot of papers out
of her bag, some stuff she had written and
didn&rsquo;t get suited with, and she stuffed them
in the stove and set fire to them. Then
we all went down to the lane to see father
and mother off and when we got back the
house was on fire. The chimney burned
out.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess mother must have written some
hot stuff,&rdquo; said Emerald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was burning so fast,&rdquo; continued
Ptolemy, &ldquo;that we didn&rsquo;t dast go in to
save anything and all our food and clothes
and balls and bats and fishing tackle are
gone, and we didn&rsquo;t know what to do, or
what to eat, and so&ndash;&ndash;we came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did just right, Ptolemy,&rdquo; I admitted.
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have called you down&ndash;&ndash;not
until I heard your story, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I held out my hand, which he shook
solemnly, but with an injured air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; asked Miss
Frayne, &ldquo;that your father and mother
went away without seeing the baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ptolemy flushed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained apologetically,
&ldquo;mother gets woolly when she writes and
she&rsquo;s forgotten there&rsquo;s Di. She thinks
Demetrius is the youngest. She&rsquo;s mad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
about writing. If she sees a blank
paper anywhere, she ain&rsquo;t happy until she
has written something on it, and the sight
of a pencil makes her fingers itch.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take warning, Miss Frayne,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t get too literary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; resumed Ptolemy,
&ldquo;mother&rsquo;ll get the antiques all out of
her system and then she&rsquo;ll remember us.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>I liked the boy&rsquo;s defense of his mother,
and I began to see that Rob was right in
thinking there were possibilities in the
lad, but it was Silvia&rsquo;s influence that had
developed them, for in the days when he
borrowed soup plates of us, there had been
no redeeming trait that I could discern.</p>
<p>And while I was recalling this, I heard
Silvia saying to him kindly: &ldquo;And in the
meantime, I&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;mudder&rsquo; to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; chimed in Beth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a big brother,&rdquo; offered Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be next friend, Ptolemy,&rdquo; I contributed.</p>
<p>Strange to say, my offer seemed to make
the most impression on him. He came to
me and gazed into my eyes earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do just as you say,&rdquo; he promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we&rsquo;uns come in?&rdquo; asked
Pythagoras, with one of his satanic grins.</p>
<p>Miss Frayne saved the day.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You all come in with me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
have lunch. I haven&rsquo;t eaten since breakfast,
and I understand there is warm ginger cake
and huckleberry pie. Aren&rsquo;t you hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; spoke up Pythagoras. &ldquo;We
only had coffee, peanuts, and beans down in
the woods, and father ate the beans and
drank all the coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of the frying pan into the
fire,&rdquo; said Silvia woefully, when we were
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the Polydore parents had gone
up in smoke,&rdquo; I declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your last hope of getting rid of
the children would have gone up in smoke,
too,&rdquo; argued Beth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; in case of the demise of their
parents, we could have turned them over
body and soul to the probate court,&rdquo; I
informed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will fill out this blank check for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
any amount, Lucien,&rdquo; declared Silvia,
&ldquo;that will induce a housekeeper to take
charge of their house. I shall keep
Diogenes, though, until he is older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind Ptolemy, either,&rdquo; I
admitted. &ldquo;I shall be interested in seeing
what I can make of him, and he hasn&rsquo;t a
bad influence over Diogenes, but I&rsquo;ll be
hanged if anything would induce me to
have &lsquo;Them Three&rsquo; Chessy cats running wild
over us. They can live in their house alone,
or be put in a reformatory. We won&rsquo;t
have them. We&rsquo;re under no obligations,
pecuniary or moral, to look after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Lucien, we might as well go
home now. We&rsquo;ve had a good rest and a
good time, and I am anxious to be back
and see how Huldah is getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Huldah had never mastered two of
the three R&rsquo;s, we had not been able to
receive any reports from her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; proposed
Beth. &ldquo;Rob and I will take all the Polydores
save Diogenes, and go home tomorrow
and prepare the house and Huldah
for the overflow. Then you two can come
on with Diogenes the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, Beth!&rdquo; I approved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
hate to face Huldah, unprepared, with the
return of the Polydores <i>en masse</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said Silvia, &ldquo;that Huldah
has been having a rest from them for a
few days.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><i>All About Uncle Issachar&rsquo;s Visit</i></h3>
</div>
<p>The next morning&rsquo;s stage carried
seven passengers to Windy Creek,
as Miss Frayne with a big roll of
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; also took her departure.</p>
<p>Diogenes had been quite docile and
amenable to my rule since the licking I
gave him, so we had a pleasant and
comfortable return journey on the following
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, Lucien,&rdquo; said Silvia, &ldquo;you
won&rsquo;t refuse to cash this check for a good
amount. The Polydore parents may never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
show up, and it&rsquo;s only right we should be
reimbursed for their keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will cash it,&rdquo; I assured her, &ldquo;and use
it for a housekeeper or else send the boys
off to a school. I should like very much
to have it out with Felix Polydore, but,
as you suggest, I may never have the
opportunity to see him at close range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beth, Rob, and Ptolemy met us at the
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are &lsquo;Them Three&rsquo;?&rdquo; I asked
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huldah is feeding them little pies hot
from the kettle&ndash;&ndash;the kind she cooks like
doughnuts, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huldah cooking for &lsquo;Them Three&rsquo;!&rdquo;
I exclaimed. &ldquo;She must have passed into
her second childhood. She grudged them
even an apple to piece on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has pampered them ever since our
return,&rdquo; said Rob.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Huldah! She must indeed be
afflicted with softening of the brain,&rdquo; I
decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has probably been so lonely, shut
in here by herself,&rdquo; said Silvia, &ldquo;that
even &lsquo;Them Three&rsquo; looked good to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the hallway Huldah met us. She
was beaming with pleasure, but except in
her bearing toward the children, she was
quite normal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all had a real good rest,&rdquo; she
observed, &ldquo;and you do look so well, Mrs.
Wade. My! but this place has been
lonesome. I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re all together
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Silvia, shut your eyes,&rdquo; directed
Beth, &ldquo;and come into the library.
Ptolemy has bought you a present with the
check his father gave him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth helped me pick it out,&rdquo; said
Ptolemy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>Beth led the way into the library, and
we followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silvia gave a little cry of pleasure, and
looking over her shoulder, I beheld a
baby grand piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ptolemy!&rdquo; she cried, giving him a
fervent kiss and fond hug, &ldquo;I can never
let you do so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, flushing a little under
the endearments which were doubtless the
first ever bestowed upon him. &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s
got a whole lot of money grandpa left him
and it&rsquo;s fixed so he can&rsquo;t draw out only so
much each year. He said the board and
bother of us was worth more than this and
we&rsquo;ll all enjoy the music. But Thag and
Em and Dem ain&rsquo;t to touch it. I&rsquo;ll
knock tar out of the first one that comes
near it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was disconsolate. I didn&rsquo;t see how we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
could return it and I didn&rsquo;t want the Polydore
web woven any tighter. To think of
Silvia&rsquo;s receiving from them what it had
been my longing to give her! But as I
was to learn later, she was to acquire much
more than a piano from the eminent
family.</p>
<p>After dinner Silvia asked Huldah to
come in and hear the music, and when
Silvia&rsquo;s repertoire was exhausted, we gave
our faithful servant all the little details of
our trip which Beth had not supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell us, Huldah, how things went
along here,&rdquo; said Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you think some wonderful things
happened to you all on your trip mebby&ndash;&ndash;ghosts
and proposals,&rdquo; looking at Beth
and Rob, &ldquo;and fires and Polydores, but
back here in this quiet house something
happened that has your ghosts and things
skinned by a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; cried Silvia apprehensively,
&ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break it very gently, Huldah,&rdquo; I
cautioned. &ldquo;You know we&rsquo;ve borne a
good deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle Issachar was here for a
couple of days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She certainly had made a sensation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Uncle Issachar! Not here?&rdquo; exclaimed
Silvia incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. He came the next day
after Beth and Mr. Rossiter and Polly
left. I told him you&rsquo;d gone away for a
little vacation and rest. I didn&rsquo;t let on
that I knew where you had gone, because
I didn&rsquo;t want him straggling up there, too,
or sending for you to come back. He
said your absence would make no difference
to his plans; that he never let nothing
do that. He come to pay a visit and he
should pay one.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Silvia feebly. &ldquo;That
sounds like Uncle Issachar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him to make himself perfectly
at home; that every one did that to this
place, and he said he would. I&rsquo;d just
slicked up the big front room upstairs
and I seen to it that he had everything
all right. I cooked the best dinner I
knew how, and he said it was the first
white man&rsquo;s meal he had eat since his ma
died, so I found out what she used to cook
and fed him on it. Them three kids and
him eat like they was holler. I guess if
Polly hadn&rsquo;t took them away your grocery
bill would &rsquo;a looked like Barb&rsquo;ry
Allen&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I was saying, your uncle he
eat till he got over his grouches, and like
enough he&rsquo;d be here eating yet, if he hadn&rsquo;t
got a telegraph to hit the line for home,
some big business deal, he said, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
guess it was a great deal, for he licked his
chops and smacked his lips over it, and he
give me a ten dollar bill to get a new dress
and each of Them Three one dollar fer
candy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old tightwad!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;It
was your cooking, sure, that made him
loosen up that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tightwad nothing!&rdquo; she declared indignantly.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t think he was tight-wadded
when you read this here letter he
left for you. He told me what was in it,
and I&rsquo;ve just been busting to tell it to
Beth, but I waited for you to know it
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With great excitement Silvia opened the
letter, read it, gasped, re-read it, and then
in consternation handed it to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it aloud, Lucien,&rdquo; she bade.
&ldquo;Maybe I can believe it then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the letter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Niece:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry not to see you, but glad to
learn that, as every wise and good woman
should do, you are raising a fine family&ndash;&ndash;a
family of <i>sons</i>, which is what our country
most needs. Your son Pythagoras informed
me that you had taken your oldest
child, Ptolemy, and your youngest, Diogenes,
with you, I am glad you left three
such promising samples for me to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you have five sons, I have, agreeable
to my promise, placed in your name in
the First National Bank of your city the
sum of twenty-five thousand dollars.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Your affectionate uncle,<br />
&ldquo;Issachar Innes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Huldah,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;did you tell him
the Polydores were our children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; she repeated indignantly. &ldquo;Me
tell a lie like that! No; I didn&rsquo;t get no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
chance to tell him anything about them.
&lsquo;Them Three&rsquo; done the telling. The first
thing that one&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;pointing to Pythagoras&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;said
was, &lsquo;Mudder went away and took
the baby, Diogenes, with her.&rsquo; And then
that next one&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;indicating Emerald&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;said:
&lsquo;Yes, and our oldest brother,
Ptolemy, went on with Beth to see them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old gent asked them all their names
and ages and he was so pleased and said he
thought it was just fine for you to raise five
sons, so I didn&rsquo;t have no heart to tell him
no different. &lsquo;Twan&rsquo;t none of my business
anyhow. Then &lsquo;Them Three&rsquo; kept talking
about stepdaddy, and your Uncle Issachar
asks &lsquo;Who the devil is he? Did my
niece marry again?&rsquo; And I told him as how
Mr. Wade was all the husband you ever had,
and that stepdaddy was nothing but a sort
of pet-name the kids had give Mr. Wade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; said Demetrius, &ldquo;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
stepdaddy was cross to us sometimes and
not as nice as mudder, and he said&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shut up,&rdquo; commanded Huldah
quickly, &ldquo;and let me talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I intercepted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d really be
interested in hearing what he told Uncle
Issachar. What was it, Demetrius, that
your great-uncle said to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said,&rdquo; stated the imp, darting his
tongue out in triumph at his victory over
Huldah, &ldquo;that he always thought you was
a stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say nothing of the kind!&rdquo;
declared Huldah. &ldquo;He said you was stiff-necked,
and that he presumed you would
act more like a stepfather than the real
thing. Well, as I was saying, he asked
their names, and he liked them fine. Said
they were so classy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say classic, Huldah?&rdquo; inquired
Rob.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby. What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;
snapped Huldah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; I assured her quickly, dodging
a definition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told him&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Emerald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shut up,&rdquo; again adjured Huldah,
&ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll never bake you one of those small
pies no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, Huldah,&rdquo; I coaxed. &ldquo;Let
us hear everything. I&rsquo;ve always told you
my life&rsquo;s secrets, and I don&rsquo;t mind what
you or the boys told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose what he was going to
tattle was that I thought the old gent
might feel hurt, &rsquo;cause none of them was
named after him, so I told him Polly&rsquo;s
middle name was Issachar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Huldah,&rdquo; remonstrated Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s always wanted a middle
name, and he&rsquo;s never been baptized, so
you can stick it in and have him ducked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
next Sunday and then that will square
that. &lsquo;Them Three&rsquo; stuck to him like
a hive of bees, and I was scairt for fear
they&rsquo;d let the cat out of the bag, and so
long as they had put it in, I thought it
might just as well stay in, but they were
just as slick as grease in all they said.
They&rsquo;ll hang in that rogues&rsquo; gallery yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they were pretty&ndash;&ndash;strenuous,&rdquo;
said Silvia with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They was more than that. The first
afternoon right after dinner when he was
sitting on the front porch, sleeping peaceful
and snoring, that there one&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; pointing
to Pythagoras&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tattle-tale!&rdquo; he began, but I administered
a cuff and he subsided into surprised
silence.</p>

&ldquo;He went to the front window and dropped a young kitten down on the old gent&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;<br />

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He,&rdquo; said Huldah, looking pleased at
this little attention to the boy, &ldquo;went to
the front window and dropped a young
kitten down on the old gent&rsquo;s head. It
clawed something fierce. We had just got
things going smooth again when Emmy
got one of his earaches. I roasted an
onion and put in his ear, and what did he
do but take it out of his ear and slip it down
your poor uncle&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you beat them?&rdquo; I asked
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the old gent did that. He put
&rsquo;em across his knee, and believe me, it was
some licking they caught. They didn&rsquo;t
let out a whimper and that pleased him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Emerald. &ldquo;Thag don&rsquo;t
know how to cry. He hasn&rsquo;t got any tears,
and old Uncle Iz didn&rsquo;t hurt me, because,
you see, when I heard Thag getting his,
I went and stuffed the Declaration of Independence,
that book of stepdaddy&rsquo;s that
Demetrius tore the pictures out of, in my
pants.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; urged Rob delightedly.
&ldquo;What else did you all do? Uncle must
have had some time. It would make a
fine scenario. &lsquo;The first visit of the rich
uncle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Huldah. &ldquo;One of &rsquo;em
put red pepper in the old man&rsquo;s bed, and
he like to sneeze his head off, but he said
as how sneezing was healthy, and showed
you&rsquo;d got rid of a cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never got on to the pepper,&rdquo; said
Demetrius gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning, that second one put a
toad in his new uncle&rsquo;s pocket, and Emmy
broke his specs. Then Meetie he dropped
his watch. They used his razor to cut the
lawn with. And then they took him down
to the creek to go fishing, and they put the
fish in Uncle&rsquo;s silk hat, and and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; implored Silvia, who was now
in tears. &ldquo;Uncle Issachar believes them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
mine! Ours! And that I brought them
up! Oh, why did we ever go away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw,&rdquo; exclaimed Huldah comfortingly,
&ldquo;he said you had brung them up
fine; that they were no mollycoddles or
Lizzie boys, and he didn&rsquo;t suppose you had
so much sense as to leave them natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A left-handed one for mudder,&rdquo; laughed
Beth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be a very peculiar man&ndash;&ndash;ready
for the asylum, I should say,&rdquo; commented
Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have been if he&rsquo;d stayed any
longer, or else I would have been,&rdquo; declared
Huldah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you make them behave, someway?&rdquo;
asked Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at first I tried to, and every time
I pinched one of &rsquo;em when the old gent
wasn&rsquo;t looking, or knocked &rsquo;em down when
I got &rsquo;em alone, they would threaten to tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
who they was, and then when I seen how
your uncle liked the way they acted, I just
let &rsquo;em go it, head on. And seeing as how
they each brung you five thousand, I&rsquo;ve
treated &rsquo;em best I know how. They&rsquo;re
worth it, now. They done one thing more
that was awful. Could you stand it to
hear?&rdquo; turning to Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Silvia,&rdquo; implored Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; argued Silvia faintly. &ldquo;I suppose
we might as well know the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see the old gent didn&rsquo;t always get
up to breakfast with the kids and one morning
when I brought in the cakes Emmy
looked up and grinned. I nearly dropped
the plate. He had both sets of the old
man&rsquo;s false teeth in his mouth. I got &rsquo;em
back in his room without his waking, but
I&rsquo;d have liked a picture of Emmy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pythagoras,&rdquo; I demanded, when we
had recovered from this recital, &ldquo;why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
didn&rsquo;t you tell him who you were, and how
you all came to be here with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she is our mudder, and we are
going to stay with her, always. We&rsquo;ve
got a snap. So has father and mother.
And Ptolemy told us that if you ever got
any kids, you&rsquo;d get five thousand each for
them, and I thought we&rsquo;d just make that
much for you. So we played Uncle Iz
for it. Easy money, all right, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about fine financiering,&rdquo; quoth
Rob. &ldquo;&lsquo;Them Three&rsquo; will surely land on
Wall Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But poor Silvia had no heart for humor
and was weeping silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look here, my dear,&rdquo; I said in
consolation, &ldquo;this is a very simple matter
to adjust. In the morning when you feel
better, just write a full explanation of the
affair and inclose your check for twenty-five
thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>Silvia quickly wiped away her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it tonight, Lucien. I feel better
now. I never thought of writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huldah and &ldquo;Them Three&rdquo; looked most
lugubrious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old skinflint won&rsquo;t miss it as much
as I would a penny,&rdquo; declared our faithful
handmaiden. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve earnt
that twenty-five thousand if anyone ever
did. You&rsquo;ve had as much care and worry
about them brats as you would if they&rsquo;d
been your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huldah,&rdquo; I said severely, &ldquo;there is a
pretty stiff penalty for obtaining money
under false pretences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all the pains we took to make
things lively for him, so he wouldn&rsquo;t get
bored and think he was having a poor time!&rdquo;
regretted Pythagoras.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And us watching every word we spoke
so as not to give it away,&rdquo; wailed Emerald.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Cake&rsquo;s all dough,&rdquo; muttered Demetrius.</p>
<p>Ptolemy regarded the three disapprovingly.
He had the old inscrutable look,
the look that foreboded mischief, in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bungled, you fool kids!&rdquo; he said
in disgust, &ldquo;and Huldah, what did you
want to let on to mudder for that he thought
we was hers? You ought to have torn up
the note he left and just said he&rsquo;d put
twenty-five thousand in the bank for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! you&rsquo;re just jealous because you
weren&rsquo;t in the Uncle Izzy deal yourself,&rdquo;
jeered Pythagoras. &ldquo;You always think
you&rsquo;re the only one that can do anything
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you had been here, Polly,&rdquo; said
Huldah, &ldquo;I am sure you could have worked
it through somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had stayed and put it across,&rdquo;
he answered. &ldquo;If you and the kids would
only learn not to blab everything you know.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
It&rsquo;s the only way to work anything. Minute
you tell a thing, it&rsquo;s all off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was still a great deal of development
work to be put on Ptolemy&rsquo;s moral standard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find, my lad,&rdquo; remonstrated
Rob, &ldquo;that honesty is the best policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been perfectly honest about
it,&rdquo; he defended. &ldquo;I would have told him
the truth, and how our parents had deserted
us, and how mudder took us in when we
were homeless and was bringing us up like
her own because she hadn&rsquo;t got any, and
how stepdaddy wanted to turn us out, and
she wouldn&rsquo;t let him, and then he would
have decided against stepdaddy and given
mudder the money so she could keep us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptolemy,&rdquo; I said warningly, &ldquo;there is a
way of telling the truth, or rather of coloring
white lies with enough truth to make
them deceive, that is more dishonorable
than an out and out lie.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Ptolemy,&rdquo; asked Silvia, &ldquo;how
did you know about that offer of five thousand
dollars for each child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I overheard it,&rdquo; he said guardedly;
&ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t remember where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He heard me say so,&rdquo; confessed Huldah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was when he first come here and he
was making us so much trouble, and I told
him it was too bad we had to have other
folks&rsquo; brats around when, if we only had
our own, they&rsquo;d be bringing in something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The recital now broke up and Silvia sat
down to write a long explanatory letter to
Uncle Issachar. The next morning I procured
her a check from the First National
Bank and she filled it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said with indrawn breath,
when she had asked me how to write
twenty-five thousand dollars, &ldquo;I never expected
to be able to sign my name to a
check for such an amount.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You never will again, I fear,&rdquo; was my
sad prophecy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must feel rich,&rdquo; said Beth, &ldquo;just to
have a large check pass through your
fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them Three&rdquo; came the nearest to tears
that they were able to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We worked so hard for it,&rdquo; they sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I!&rdquo; muttered Huldah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t live a double life,&rdquo; declared
Silvia.</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter XVIII</span></h2>
<h3><i>In Which I Decide on Extreme Measures</i></h3>
</div>
<p>Everyone in our house, which was
now filled to overflowing&ndash;&ndash;in fact,
there were Polydores on sofas and
in beds on the floor&ndash;&ndash;save Silvia and
myself, was on the alert for a response to
the letter during the succeeding few days.
Knowing Uncle Issachar, we felt sure he
would make no response, or notice the
matter in any way save to cash the check
promptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>The monotony was somewhat relieved
by the difficulties under which Beth and
Rob were pursuing their courtship. On
the third evening succeeding our return,
Silvia and I started upstairs early to give
them a chance to have the exclusive use of
the library, the Polydores having all been
sent to bed. As we were making some
plausible excuse for going to our room,
Beth remarked with a smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your motive in retiring so early is commendable,
but of no particular benefit to
Rob and me. The Polydores, like the poor,
we always have with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that every one of them except
Ptolemy was in bed at eight o&rsquo;clock last
night and the night before,&rdquo; said Silvia.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do mean,&rdquo; laughed Beth. &ldquo;Not
Ptolemy, though. He has become too
dignified to spy on us, but last night as we
sat here on the settee, we heard a suppressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
sneeze, and Rob pulled Emerald
from underneath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did he ever squeeze
under there?&rdquo; I asked, gazing at the
slight space between the floor and settee.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_44' id='linki_44'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-049.jpg' alt='' title='' width='357' height='266' /><br />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;He did look a little flattened, as if he
had been put in a letter press,&rdquo; said Rob.
&ldquo;I gave him a dime to go to bed and stay
there. Beth and I had just resumed our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
conversation when a still, small voice said:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to bed for a dime, too.&rsquo; I then
hauled Demetrius from behind the davenport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the night before,&rdquo; said Beth, &ldquo;when
we were sitting on the porch, Pythagoras
rolled off the roof, where he had been listening
to us, and came down into the vines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll stop that,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tie them in their beds and lock the doors
and windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; refused Rob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try
to circumvent them by their own weapons
of wits. I have a little plan which I don&rsquo;t
dare whisper to you lest their long-range
ears get in their work. We are just about
to start for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this pouring rain!&rdquo; protested Silvia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We like the rain,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and we&ndash;&ndash;are
not going far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pythagoras entered the room just then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
and looked astounded and disappointed
when he saw Beth and Rob departing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going out to a small party,&rdquo;
Rob remarked to me, casually.</p>
<p>It was after eleven when we heard them
returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they have been walking
all this time?&rdquo; said Silvia in concern.
&ldquo;Beth wore no rubbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday and Huldah
put into execution a plan for procuring
one happy hour each week. This plan was
the admission of the Polydores, <i>en masse</i>,
to one of the Sunday schools. She chose
the church most remote from home so they
would be a long time going and coming,
which she said would &ldquo;help some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Beth, as she watched them
march away, &ldquo;I can dare to tell you where
we spent last evening. We were at the
Polydore house next door. There is a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
vine-screened porch on the other side of
the house. Rob managed to open one
of the windows and brought out a couple
of chairs. It was as snug as could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll corral them every night,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;until you make your getaway, and I&rsquo;ll
give you the key so you can go inside when
it is cool or stormy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go around the block by way of
precaution,&rdquo; said Rob.</p>
<p>Presently Huldah returned from the
Sunday school with triumphant mien.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They made them all into one class and
put a redheaded woman with spectacles
in for their teacher. I gave them street
car tickets to come home on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Polydores returned, however,
they were dragging Diogenes along and he
looked quite weary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you come home on the street
car?&rdquo; I asked Ptolemy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No; we sold our tickets and got ice
cream sodas,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We took
turns carrying Diogenes on our backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You only had one ticket for yourself,
and two half fares for Thag and Emmy,&rdquo;
said Huldah suspiciously. &ldquo;I thought
Meetie and Di could ride free. You
couldn&rsquo;t have sold them tickets for enough
for sodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob gave us three nickels to put in the
plate,&rdquo; said Pythagoras. &ldquo;We only put in
one of them, seeing we were all in one family
and one class. That gave us four nickels
for ice cream sodas and the clerk gave
Di half a glass some one had left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave you a penny for Di to put in,&rdquo;
said Huldah. &ldquo;What did you do with
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted him to put it in, and when
they took up the collection, he wouldn&rsquo;t
give it,&rdquo; said Emerald. &ldquo;I tried to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
it away from him and he swallowed it.
The redhead teacher was awful scared,
but I told her he was used to swallowing
things and that you said he carried a whole
department store in his insides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little Di,&rdquo; said Silvia; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the
only way he has of keeping things away
from you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night I saw to it personally that
each and every Polydore was in his little
bed. It should have aroused my suspicions
that none of them rebelled, or had
evinced the slightest degree of interest or
curiosity when Beth and Rob announced
their intention of going out for the evening.</p>
<p>At ten-thirty the lovers returned, bringing
in Pythagoras, who was clad in his
pajamas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you pick him up?&rdquo; I asked
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He picked us up,&rdquo; said Beth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He was wise, maybe, in discovering
where we were,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;but he fell
down when he tried to work off the ghost
screeches on us. We recognized them at
once, and ran him down inside, so our
party broke up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Pythagoras,&rdquo; I commanded.</p>
<p>He obeyed promptly and fearlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know they were there,
and when did you go over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was playing over in our house today,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;and I found one of Beth&rsquo;s
hairpins with the little stones in, in the big
chair, so I knew that was where they hid
last night. As soon as you went down stairs
tonight, I got out the window and slid down
the roof and came over to scare them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve missed a lot of sleep the last
few nights,&rdquo; I said quietly, &ldquo;so you will
have to make it up. You can stay in bed
all day tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Lucien!&rdquo; exclaimed Rob.
&ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s the big baseball game of
the season, and I promised to take them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He
will learn to mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pythagoras looked as if he had been
struck, and quickly put his arms across
his eyes. In a moment his shoulders were
heaving. At last I had found a vulnerable
spot in the stoic, and I began to relent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Pythagoras,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if I let
you up in time to go to the game, will you
promise me something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; came in a muffled voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you promise not to spy on Beth
and Rob and keep Emerald and Demetrius
from doing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he promised quickly, his arm
coming down and his face brightening.
&ldquo;Sure I will, but I did want to hear what
they said.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Rob interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting up a show, and Em is
going to take the part of a girl and he spoons
with Tolly, and we didn&rsquo;t know what to
have them say to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rehearse you on the play, and
prompt you,&rdquo; said Beth with a little
giggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on upstairs with me now,&rdquo; I
said to Pythagoras.</p>
<p>When I landed him at his door, he leaned
up against me, and rubbed his cheek against
my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for letting me go to the
game,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I found myself responding to his affectionate
advance. This would clearly never
do. I couldn&rsquo;t let another Polydore squeeze
himself into my regard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silvia,&rdquo; I said abruptly, as I came into
our room, &ldquo;we must really make some immediate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
plan for disposing of the Polydores,
or, at least, of &lsquo;Them Three.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huldah is managing them tolerably
well,&rdquo; demurred Silvia. &ldquo;Since they depreciated
in market value from five thousand
per to nothing, she has resumed her
former harsh treatment of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are not going to keep them,&rdquo;
I replied with finality. &ldquo;We are under no
obligations to do so. I am going to put them
in a school for boys and use the blank check
Felix Polydore left to pay for their tuition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is what we will have to
do,&rdquo; she admitted with a little sigh. &ldquo;Yet,
Lucien, it doesn&rsquo;t seem quite right. If
they are in a boys&rsquo; school, they will keep
on right along the same lines. They need
home influence and contact with women.
Demetrius is fond of music and will sit
still and listen when I play. Emerald
obeyed me today the first time I spoke,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
and I even thought I saw a glimmer of good
in Pythagoras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell her that this glimmer was
what had decided me to dispose of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would, doubtless, be better for them
to stay,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;but I am not going to
be a martyr to the cause. They are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning I wrote for catalogues
and prospectus to the different schools,
and I felt as if three old men of the sea
had been lifted from my shoulders.</p>

<h2><span class='smcap'>Chapter</span> XIX</h2>
<h3><i>Which Has to Do with Some Letters</i></h3>
</div>
<p>One morning when I came down to
my office, I found a letter postmarked
from the city in which
Uncle Issachar lived addressed to me. I
opened it and found inclosed, with seal
unbroken, the letter Silvia had mailed to
her uncle and which she had marked &ldquo;personal.&rdquo;
There was a note addressed to
me accompanying it:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Sir:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am returning herewith your personal
letter to Mr. Innes, as he has gone to
South America and left no forwarding
address. Should such be received from
him at any future date, you will be duly
notified thereof.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Very truly yours,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;Chester K. Winslow,<span class='rindent6'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;Secretary.&rdquo;<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read the above to Silvia at luncheon.
She was grievously disappointed because
her uncle had not received her letter of
explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most fortunate,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that
I sent it in one of your office envelopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As usual, she had found the bright spot
she always looked for and generally discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
Uncle Issachar&rsquo;s private secretary or the
dead-letter office know all our private
affairs, but I shall feel like an impostor
until Uncle Issachar is undeceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel a hunch,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;that Uncle
Issachar will run across Doctor Felix and his
wife down there in Chili and find you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may run across the Polydores,&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;ll never find out from
them that they are the parents of Silvia&rsquo;s
children. They would not mention a subject
in which they have so little interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; argued Beth, &ldquo;naturally they&rsquo;d
tell him where they lived, and then, of
course, he&rsquo;d say he had a niece living in
the same town. They would inquire her
name and inform him that they were her
near neighbors, and then he&rsquo;d tell them
what fine sons you have, and then, of course,
the Polydores would claim their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which theory goes to show,&rdquo; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
Silvia, &ldquo;how little you know Uncle Issachar
and the Polydore seniors. He would
not think of speaking to strangers, and if
he did, he wouldn&rsquo;t say any of those usual
conversational things you mentioned. The
Polydores wouldn&rsquo;t be interested, in the
least, in knowing he had a niece unless she
happened to know something about
antiques, and if he should describe her
children, she wouldn&rsquo;t recognize them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After luncheon I went out on the porch.
While I sat there, the mail carrier came
along and handed me a letter&ndash;&ndash;a returned
letter. It was directed in Ptolemy&rsquo;s round
hand to Mr. Issachar Innes. He had
evidently used the envelope to Silvia&rsquo;s
letter to her uncle as his model, for the
address was written in the same way.
&ldquo;Personal&rdquo; was added in the left-hand
corner, and his name and our house number
was in the upper left-hand corner.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>I went into the library where my wife,
Beth, Rob, and Ptolemy were sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptolemy,&rdquo; I said, handing him the
letter, &ldquo;here is your communication to
Uncle Issachar, returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lost some of his usual <i>sang froid</i>
and appeared quite disconcerted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ptolemy,&rdquo; exclaimed Silvia in
consternation, &ldquo;what in the world did
you write to Uncle Issachar about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ptolemy had recovered and was quite
himself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About us,&rdquo; he said innocently. &ldquo;As
the oldest of our family, I thought I ought
to do a little explaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think,&rdquo; I said, looking at him
keenly, &ldquo;that we have the right to know
what your explanation was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ptolemy handed me over the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it aloud,&rdquo; he said, with the air
of one who is proud of his productions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s eyes shone in anticipation.</p>
<p>I broke the seal. A note from the
secretary fell out. It was an apology for
not returning the letter sooner, but it had
been inadvertently mislaid. I then read
aloud the letter Ptolemy had written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Uncle Issachar</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry Diogenes and I were away
when you were here. You thought the
others were fine, but you should have
seen&ndash;&ndash;Diogenes. I hope you will send
mudder back her check, because there is lots
of things she needs, and it takes a lot of
money to take care of all us. You see
our own father and mother don&rsquo;t want to
be bothered with us and they went away
and left us, and so we are living with
mudder the same as if we were really her
adopted children, and if her own would
have been worth five thousand per to you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
I think her adopted children ought to be
worth half as much anyway, so it would
only be fair to send her a check for $12,500
anyway, and if you are a good sport like
the kids said you were, you&rsquo;ll send back
her check.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Yours truly,<span class='rindent11'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;P. Issachar Polydore Wade.&rdquo;<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s laughter was so free and spontaneous
that I had to join in against my
will. Ptolemy, who had seemed a little
apprehensive of the verdict, looked accordingly
relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine letter, young man,&rdquo; approved
Rob. &ldquo;Stepdaddy ought to take
you into his law firm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; declared Beth. &ldquo;I think Ptolemy
has inherited his mother&rsquo;s gift. He
should be a writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; cried Ptolemy with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
feeling. &ldquo;I want to live things instead
of writing about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tear or two came into Silvia&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very sweet in you, Ptolemy, to
try to get the money for mudder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that all this commendation was
bad for Ptolemy, and that it was up to
me to take a reef in his sails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a well-meant letter, Ptolemy,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;and I know that your motive was
unselfish, but it is very poor policy to
meddle in other people&rsquo;s affairs. Meddlers
are mischief makers in spite of their
good intentions. I am very glad it did
not fall into Uncle Issachar&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ptolemy looked sufficiently squelched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Silvia,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I wrote
Mr. Winslow and told him not to forget
to forward Uncle Issachar&rsquo;s address as soon
as he possibly could do so, as I had matters
of importance to communicate to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He may travel about like father and
mother,&rdquo; said Ptolemy, again regaining
confidence, &ldquo;so why don&rsquo;t you put that
check for twenty-five thousand in the
Savings Department and get the interest
on it anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Ptolemy,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;that you
are too good a financier, after all, to become
a lawyer. I will go back to my first
conviction that you should be a promoter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him to Uncle Issachar,&rdquo; I
proposed, &ldquo;for a partner.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><i>&ldquo;The Money We Earnt for You&rdquo;</i></h3>
</div>
<p>Life went on uneventfully save for
the dire doings of &ldquo;Them Three.&rdquo;
Knowing that they were to be sent
to school, they were having their last fling
at life untrammeled. September came,
and Rob set the day for his departure, as
he was going home to arrange his affairs,
so he and Beth could leave for an extended
honeymoon trip. I planned to go with
Rob and install the Polydore three in their
distant school. They were so despondent
at leaving, as the time drew near, that a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
feeling of gloom hung over the household,
all the members of which, even to Huldah,
urged me to relent. But I remained adamant
until the evening before the day set
for the dissolution of the Polydore family,
when something happened that changed
all our plans.</p>
<p>We were assembled in the library in a
state of forced cheerfulness when the doorbell
rang. I answered it, and receipted
for a telegram which I opened and read in
the hall. It was from Chester K. Winslow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silvia,&rdquo; I said gravely, as I returned
to the library, &ldquo;your Uncle Issachar is
dead. Died in South America. Heart disease.
Very sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conflicting emotions were depicted in
Silvia&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>The thought uppermost in all our minds
was expressed simultaneously by &ldquo;Them
Three.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! Then you can keep the money
we earnt for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; interpolated Rob in soft-pedaled
tone, &ldquo;they are going to train
school children toward the military&ndash;&ndash;teach
the young ideas how to shoot, as it were.
It won&rsquo;t be long before they are ordered
to Mexico to protect us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Them Three ever meets that there
Viller man,&rdquo; commented Huldah confidently,
&ldquo;the fur will fly some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucien,&rdquo; said Silvia thoughtfully, &ldquo;we
are under obligations to these children,
you see, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I acknowledged with a sigh,
&ldquo;seeing they are now ours, bought and
paid for, I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to treat them
as such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t send your own kids
away to school,&rdquo; said Pythagoras significantly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I reluctantly allowed, answering
the protest of Pythagoras, &ldquo;and we won&rsquo;t
send you. You will all go to the public
school tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deafening Polydore powwow that
followed made me hope that Uncle Issachar
had met with his just deserts.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
